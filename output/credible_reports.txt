SUBJECT Executive Summary of Allegations of Civilian Casualties (CIVCAS ) Resulting from
5-6 November 14 Airstrikes in the vicinity of (IVO) Harim , Syria

13 February 2015

1. Duringthe late night and early morning hours ofNovember5-6, 2014, coalition aircraft
conducted airstrikes on targets inthe vicinity of Harim City, Idlib Governate, Syria. The strikes
were designed to destroy targets utilized by Khorasan Group -affiliated extremists to meet and
manufacture explosives, including an explosives-making and storage facility used by known
improvised explosive device (IED) manufacturers. Khorasan Group targets were assessed as
destroyed as a result of those airstrikes. Despite the success of the airstrikes indestroying the
targets, the strikes likely resulted inthe deaths of two civilians, and caused minor injuries to two
other civilians residing near one ofthe targeted locations.

2. During November, 2014 United States Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) received reports
of civilian casualties (CIVCAS resulting from an airstrike inthe vicinity of Harim City. The
reports appeared to describe the November 5-6 airstrikes. The reports contained statements that
confirmed the airstrikes targeted specific buildings that had been verified as enemy locations,
and the airstrikes were accurate in striking those locations. The reports stated that the strikes
destroyed buildings and ammunition depots used by enemy forces, and killedknown fighters, but
also caused deaths and injuries to civilians,

including the daughter of a known enemy fighter.

3. As a result ofthe reports ofCIVCAS, a credibility assessment of the allegations was
conducted by the Combined Joint Task Force Operation InherentResolve (CJTF -OIR ) on
December 22, 2014andcompleted on December31, 2014. The assessment found some of
CIVCAS allegationsto be initially credible based on the information available. Therefore, the
Commander, CJTF -OIR , initiated this formal investigation.

4. The November 5-6, 2014 airstrikesin the vicinity of HarimCity, Syria, likely resulted in the
destructionofKhorasanGroup-affiliated targets that hadbeen convertedto military use. The
primaryweapons used against the targets functioned properly accurately struck the intended
targets, andcaused secondary explosions.

5. A preponderanceofthe evidence available indicates the strikes likely resulted inthe deaths of
two civilianchildrenat or near one ofthe targeted locations. The childrenhad not been assessed
as residing at any ofthe targets. The strikes also caused minor injuriesto two civilian (b) 6)

informationavailable, the exact locationsofthe civilians inrelationto the targets, andwhether
the civilians were killedor injuredby primary or secondary explosionscouldnot be determined.

6. The targets engaged were valid military targets at the time of the strikes. The airstrikes in
question were conducted in accordance with all military authorities, targeting guidance, and
applicable rules of engagement. Additionally, reasonable measures were undertaken to avoid the
death or injury of civilians during the strike by thoroughly reviewing the targets prior to
engagement, relying on accurate assessments of the targets, and engaging the targets when the
risk to non -combatants was minimized. Nonetheless, the death of any civilians is regrettable,
and coalition targeting practices incorporating mitigation measures to prevent civilian casualties
to the maximum extent possible based on operational requirements, the rules of engagement, and
the Law of Armed Conflict will be continued.

targets. Dual use facilities are valid military targets characterized as serving both a
military and civilian (i.e., noncombatant) purpose or function . Dual-use facilities may
also consist of NSFs occupied by enemy combatants. NSFs occupied by enemy
combatants for the purpose of advancing military objectives lose their LOAC protection

proper authority to
supporting military operations and / or objectives exclusively, it is
not classified as dual-use. A targeted facility formerly characterized as dual- use must
have its protected status removed by proper authority before it may be engaged. Only

is determined that the predominant function or purpose of the target is to advance

The first attack : Idlib countryside Harem
On Thursday 6 November 2014 at
AM, the international alliance warplanes
targeted four military point for An-Nussra front in Idlib northern countryside - Ha

missiles that hit three military points which are located next to each other
in the
northeast of the town :
1 - The Agricultural bank , which is used by An-Nussra front as a center.
2 - The central prison checkpoint
3 - An ammunition depot in the same area .
The shelling destroyed and burned the agricultural bank's building completely in
addition to damaging a number of building nearby. Furthermore
number of cars
were burned while a series of explosions occurred after an explosion in the ammu
nition depot which why no one was able to get near the targeted area.
Afterwards the warplanes targeted a fourth center with two missiles. The center.
which was a building by an old deserted gas station located near the industrial school
in the south of the town. The shelling destroyed the center completely as well as
the gas station in addition to severely damaging the surrounding buildings. Harem

On Thursday 6 November 2014 at 2:15 AM the international alliance, for the first
time, targeted a center for Ahrar Ash - Sham movement in Idlib countryside - Babs
qa village, which is located near Bab AlHawa crossing with Turkey. The shelling
targeted specifically a warehouse owned by one of the village residents who rented
it to AhrarAsh-Sham which used it as an ammunitiondepot. The shelling destroyed

used by An -Nussra front as a center was destroyed completely. A numberof resi
dents told us that the victims of the shelling were civilians but we found out later
they were An- Nussra fighters.
Mr.Yaman, lives in the area, told
" At dawn, we woke up to the sound of powerful warplanes which was different
from the Syrian regime warplanes . There were two incredibly fast warplanes at
least soaring at a relatively low height. The sound was strong that it shook the win
dows. At 4:15 AM a huge explosion happened. We heard the sound coming from
Al-Muhandsien southwestern countryside. After two hours. I headed to the place.
There was a building that was demolished completely."

Recommendations

The international alliance
should respect the international humanitarian law
and the customary international law . Furthermore, the alliance should bear the con
sequences of these violations and insure that it won't occur again.
The civilians, specifically in areas that are shelled frequently by the international
alliance forces must be properly aided. Also more field hospitals should be estab
lished . Additionally. IDPs camps on the Turkish -Syrian borders can be built on a
larger scale.
We believe that a safe zone, where camps can be built
significantly help the
IDPs and the refugees that might leave Lebanon and Turkey and the other countries
to live in the safe zone
Civilians must be protected from the brutality of the Syrian regime and its extremist
militias. A no -fly zone should be imposed in order to put an end to the daily barrel
bombs shelling as well as protecting the Syrian civilians from the brutality of ISIS

FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

CTJF- OIRCompletesCivilianCasualty Investigation

TAMPA, Fla.
Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve
commander, has reviewed and approved the findings and recommendations of an investigation that he
directed into allegations that U.S. airstrikes against a network of veteran al Qa'ida operatives, sometimes
called “ Khorasan Group” Nov. 5-6, 2014, in the vicinity of Harim City, Syria, likely resulted in non
combatant casualties.

The preponderance of the evidence in the investigation indicates the airstrikes conducted against facilities
used by Khorasan Group in the vicinity of Harim City, Syria,
likely led to the deaths of two non
combatant children . Terry directed the investigation on Jan. 8 , 2015 and approved the findings of the
investigation on April 5 , 2015 .

The redacted investigationhas been released and is available at USCENTCOM's Freedomof Information
Act Reading Room at http://tinyurl.com/USCENTCOM-CIVCAS-INVESTIGATION.

Prior to the strikes, the Department of Defense conducted a thorough assessment, review, and validation
process of the targeted buildings, and assessed that the Khorasan Group was using them exclusively for
military purposes. In that assessment process, there was no indication that there were children at any of
the targeted buildings. The strikes also resulted in minor injuries to two adult non -combatants residing
near one of the targets.

The investigationconcluded that the Nov. 5-6 airstrikes in the vicinity of Harim City, Syria, resultedin
the destructionofthe KhorasanGroup targets. All ordnance functionedproperly and struck their intended
targets accurately. This triggered secondary explosions.

The airstrikes were conducted in accordance with applicable military authorizations, targeting guidance,
and applicable rules of engagement. The targets engaged were valid military targets, and the Law of
Armed Conflict principles of military necessity, humanity, proportionality, and distinction were adhered
to during the targeting and engagement process. Measures were taken to avoid unintended death or injury
of non -combatants during the strike by reviewing the targets thoroughly prior to engagement, relying on
accurate assessments of the targets, and engaging the targets when the risk to non-combatants was
minimized

“ We regret the unintentional
“ The Coalition continues to take all reasonable
measures during the targeting process to mitigate risks to non -combatants, and to comply with the
principles of the Law of Armed Conflict .

I sent it over on the NIPR side.

We do not have to make a determination that it is CIVCAS nor do we even have to make a credibility determination
since it was not our strike. The policy states, " All allegations of possible or suspected CIVCAS, received through
any source, will be promptly reported..." We have met that very low burden.

This is the CAOCs issue, they own the CIVCAS problem at this time . Since the Army has single service claims
responsibility in Iraq, however , we own any potential claim.

I will ensure any claim is appropriately handled.

destroyed in a Coalition airstrike on 13 March. She is seeking reimbursement

for her vehicle , which was being

Casualty Report

Published April 30 , 2017

April 30, 2017
Release # 20170430-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTASIA — During the month of March 2017, CJTF-OIR carried over 43
open reports of possible civilian casualties from previous months, received 27 new
reports, and completed the assessment on 28 reports resulting from Coalition strikes
in Iraq and Syria in the fight to defeat ISIS. Seventeen of these reports were
assessed to be non-credible, nine were assessed to be credible, and two reports
were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports. A total of 42 reports are still open
and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as ground
artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to promote a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date , based on data between August 2014 and March 2017 , the Coalition has
conducted a total of 20,205 strikes that included 42,089 separate engagements .
During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 396 .
The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was

102. The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian
casualties was .94%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report
of civilian casualties was
% . In last month's report this information was incorrectly
reported as February data , when in fact all but the strike numbers were accurate as of
31 March

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed that the following 17 reports are non-credible . Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties .

1. March 23, 2016 , near Hajj Ali, Iraq, via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was almost 4 km away.

June 18, 2016 , near Manbij , Syria , via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

3. Jan. 6, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq , via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted
in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties .

4. Jan. 14, 2017 , near Mosul , via NGO report: After a review of available information
and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

5. Jan. 15, 2017 , near Raqqah, Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

6. Jan. 17, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information

7. Jan. 22, 2017, near Nayrab, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 30 km away.

8. Feb. 3 , 2017 , near DayrAz Zayr, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 35 km away.

9. Feb. 7 , 2017 , near Idlib, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 90 km away.

10. Feb. 14, 2017, near Mosul,
, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient
information available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

11. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . A
similar report of possible civilian casualties less than a kilometer away is still being
assessed .

12. Feb. 19, 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was approximately a
kilometer away. After a review of available information and strike video it was
assessed that there is insufficient information available to determine if civilians were
present or harmed in strikes in that area.

13. Feb. 20 , 2017 near Dayr Az Zayr , Syria , via social media report: No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

14. Feb. 20 , 2017, near Raqqah , Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

a

15. Feb. 22, 2017 near Tabqah , Syria, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

16. March 5 , 2017, near Raqqah, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

17. March 12, 2017 , near Maskana , Syria , via social media report No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner

that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Nine reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 45 civilians.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty.
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred .

In each of the incidents below , the investigation assessed that

1. Nov. 17, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on partnered forces from a building Nov. 18, it was assessed that eight civilians
were unintentionally killed and 12 civilians unintentionally injured in the building .

2. Dec. 11, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on Coalition and partnered forces , it was assessed that the strike impacted an
ISIS weapons cache that set off secondary explosions that set an adjacent building
on fire killing eight civilians in the building .

3. Feb. 9 , 2017 , near Al Qaim , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle , it was assessed that two civilians were unintentionally injured when
they entered the target area after the munition was released .

4. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on an ISIS
command and control node , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally
killed

5. Feb. 22 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in a
moving vehicle , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed when he
entered the target area after the munition was released .

6. Feb. 27, 2017 , near Al Qaim, Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed and one
civilian unintentionally injured
another moving vehicle that came into the proximnity
of the target vehicle at the time of the attack .

7. March 1, 2017, near Mosul
VBIED factory, it was assessed that the strike blast set off a secondary explosion of
an ISIS VBIED parked next to a house down the street from the target location
resulting in the unintentional death of 14 civilians.

Iraq, via media report: During a strike on an ISIS

8. March 3 , 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on an ISIS

In February and March , the Coalition completed an audit of its civilian casualty report
tracking and reporting from August 2014 to the present. The audit determined that 10
previously released reports of civilian casualties were incorrectly reported resulting in
a net reduction of two civilians killed .

1. March 13, 2015, near Hatra, Iraq: On the Nov. 20, 2015, U.S. Central Command
press release it was reported that four civilians were killed during a strike on an ISIS
checkpoint. A subsequent investigation concluded that 11 civilians were
unintentionally killed.

2. Sept. 10 2015, in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit: Number 1 on the Apr. 22, 2016, U.S.
Central Command press release reported that two civilians were killed and four
injured during a strike on an ISIL checkpoint. This was incorrect, it was assessed that
four civilians were unintentionally killed and two injured.

3. Sept. 24, 2015, near Sinjar, Iraq: Number 3 on the Jan. 29, 2016, U.S. Central
Command press release it was reported that two civilians were killed during a strike
on an ISIS vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was
unintentionally killed.

4. June 21 , 2016 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria : Number 12 and 13 on the Nov. 9 , 2016 ,

U.S. Central Command press release were both based on the same report. The
actual assessment was that on June 21, 2016, near Ar Raqqah, during a strike on an
ISIS headquarters four civilians were unintentionally killed.

5. June 26, 2016, near Mosul, Iraq: Number 15 on the Nov. 9 , 2016, U.S Central
Command press release reported that one individual was injured after entering the
target area after the aircraft released its weapon. That was incorrect, it was assessed
that one civilian was unintentionally killed.

6. July 14, 2016, near Qayyarah ,
Command press release reported that one civilian was killed during a strike on an
ISIS-held building . That was incorrect,
unintentionally injured.

Iraq: Number 18 on the Nov. 9 , 2016, U.S. Central

it was assessed that one civilian was

7. Oct. 4 , 2016, near Talatanah, Syria : Number 5 on the Dec. 1, 2016, CJTF-OIR
press release reported that one civilian was killed during a strike on ISIS fighters.
That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally injured.

8. Nov. 6 , 2016, near Shahid-Yunis As Sab, Iraq Number 1 on the Jan 2 , 2017,
CJTF-OIR press release reported that seven civilians were killed during a strike on
ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that two
civilians were unintentionally killed and five injured.

9. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq : Number 4 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press
release reported that one civilian was unintentionally injured in a house . That was
incorrect , it was assessed that the report of civilian casualties was non-credible .

10. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul ,
release reported that during a strike on ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle one civilian
was unintentionally killed. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one individual was
unintentionally injured .

Iraq: Number 5 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press

Additionally , it is assessed that 80 civilian casualties attributable to Coalition strikes to
defeat
ISIS in Iraq and Syria from August 2014 to the present had not previously been
announced .

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is more likely
than not, at least 352 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes
since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. We regret the unintentional loss of
civilian lives resultingfrom Coalition efforts to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and
express our deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

U.S. Central Command announced the results of several civilian

TAMPA , Fla.
casualty assessments today. After a thorough review of the facts and
circumstances for each allegation, the preponderance of evidence indicates five
arate U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria , between April 12 and July 4 , have likely
resulted in the death of eight civilians and injuries to an additional three civilians .
We deeply regret the unintentional
airstrikes and express our deepest sympathies to the victims' families and those
affected

loss of life and injuries resulting from those

The Coalition takes all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties during the
course of military operations. In all of the cases released today , assessments
determined that although the air strikes complied with the law of armed conflict
and all appropriate precautions were taken , civilian casualties unfortunately did

We are sharing this information with the public as part of our commitment to
transparency. We continue to review additional claims of civilian casualties and
will provide additional information in the future.

Here is a description of the five U.S. strikes alleged to have resulted in civilian
casualties and determined to be credible :

1. On April 12 , 2015, near al Huwayjah , Iraq, during a strike on an ISIL tactical
unit, it was assessed that two unidentified civilians were killed .

2. On June 11, 2015, near Soluk, Syria, during strikes against an ISIL tactical unit,
it is assessed that three unidentified civilians were killed.

3. On June 19, 2015, near Tall alAdwaniyah, Syria, during a strike against two ISIL
vehicles, it is assessed that one civilian was injured when appearing in the target
area after the U.S. aircraft released its weapon .

4. On June 29 2015, near Haditha, Iraq, during strikes against one ISIL tactical
unit and two ISIL vehicles , it is assessed that two civilians were injured. After the
U.S. aircraft engaged the target and two seconds prior to impact, a car slowed in
front of the ISIL vehicles while a motorcycle simultaneously passed by. The target
vehicle was destroyed in the strike but there was insufficient evidence to
determine the level of injuries to the civilians operating the passing car and
motorcycle.

5. On July 4 , 2015 , near Ar Raqqah, Syria , during a strike against an ISIL High
Value Individual , a car and a motorcycle entered the target area after the weapon
was released . It is assessed that three unidentified civilians were likely killed.

ASSESSMENT RESPONSE :

SECRETHREL TO USA,

Analysis: BOA determined that, as a result of this strike,
there were 6 EKIA, 3 weapons caches destroyed, and 1
resupplyvehicle destroyed. The CIVCAS allegation
specificallyalleges 6 civilians killed in a civilian vehicle,
which closely aligns with the BOA, aside from the
characterizationof enemy vs. civilian .
target the 6
personnel and vehicle, they would have been positively
identified as contributingto enemy military action by a
standardof reasonable certainty. However, due to the
descript nature of the CIVCAS allegation and the fact that
the numbers so closely align, it is plausible that the
Coalitionassessmentof PIO was incorrect. It is possible
that the distribution of oil could have been misinterpreted
as enemy in nature, due to a common ISIS TTP of selling
and distributingoil
generaterevenuefrom civilians.
Due to TOA and the amount of time that has lapsed since
the strike, I am unableto obtain any additional
informationon

and this strike.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sep. 3 , 2014 near Mosul, Iraq , via Airwars report: After a review of available
information it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted in the
geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties .

the CAOC assessesthat allegation of civilian casualties ( CIVCAS) resulting from a

number of civilian or ISIL casualties caused by the secondary explosions cannot be
confirmed at this time.

a strike against a known ISIL

An air strike by a U.S.led coalition flattened an entire neighbourhoodof a northem
Iraqi town controlled by Islamic State militants, killing dozens ofpeople including civilians,
witnesses and security sources said.

The strike targeted an Islamic State bomb -making factory in Hawija overnight on

Tuesday, triggering a series of secondary explosions that reduced the surrounding area in
the industrial district to rubble.

Residentsandsecurity sourcesput the numberofpeoplekilled at around70
Sixty -seven -year -old Hawija resident Hassan Mahmoud al-Jubbouri said he heard

In a statement on Wednesday, the coalitionsaid an air strike targeteda "vehicle

A seniormilitary source in the coalition said he was not aware of the strike in

A resident of the area in which the explosion took place said Islamic State had a
strong presence there and was stockpilingammunitionas well as manufacturingbombs
The militants had two explosives- rigged tankers ready, he said, putting the number of
people killed at 70, including both militants and civilians "Many families were buried
beneath their houses and are believed to have died ". A security official in Kirkuk,
LieutenantIbrahim Jawdat, said initialintelligence reports from sources inside Hawija
suggestedat least 74 people were killed, among them civilians.

Sheikh Anwar al-A(cid:0)i al Obeidi, who fled Hawija after Islamic State took over last

June, said members of his tribe in the town told him a large number of civilians had been
killed, and the industrial district resembled the site of an earthquake.

Based on the size of the secondary explosion , caused

by the explosive contents of the target building,
significant damage to structures as far as 1250 feet from the target

the blast, 111buildings were confirmed destroyed, 75 buildings
sustained severe damage, 86 buildings sustained moderatedamage, and
160 buildings sustained light damage. Of note, a residentialarea located
approximately500 feet north of the target area, had 25 buildings

buildings sustained moderatedamage, and 103 buildings sustainedlight
damage. Due to the substantial amountof damage in this area alone, it
is credible that civilian casualties may have occurred Figure7 shows

I did not think it was a reasonable assumption to think that there would not

Here are theresponses to the questions vou asked over the phone regarding the Hawiyjah ISIL VBIED
Factory (1)
the TET Chief, for their situational
awareness.
1. What were your duties and responsibilitiesinthe target development process
My section is responsible for the advanced target development (ATD) in the target development
process. ATD involves weaponeering, precise point mensuration, and collateral damage estimation .
2. What documents, publications, checklists were used during the weaponeering work ?

3. In general, what are the weaponeering proceduresto achievethe required effect for a target in
populated areas?

The weaponeering software is used to give the user a probability of success based on the target model
the weapon type and number of weapons used, and all of the user defined parameters, variables, and
assumptions. Weaponeering is focused on howto achieve the defined criteria for success, which is,
in
other words, the specific kinetic effect on the target. This has nothing to do with whether or not the
area is populated . CDE Methodology, according to CJCSI3160.01A ,
is designed to increase levels of
mitigationto collateral damage asthe risk increases. While the CDE Methodology does not account for

Yes and no . Sensitive target criteria involves chemical, biological, or radiological plume hazards or
casualty count higher
environmental hazards, CAT I No- Strike Entities, and other situations that drive
. The target did not meet any of those criteria due to the fact that CDE Methodology does

10. What products were produced for the Al Hawijah VBIED Factory ?
The TARPACK (attached ) includes the weaponeering, aimpoint, and CDE graphic .
11. To whom and when were the products provided ?
It was provided
12. Did you have any concerns with this target during weaponeering ?
Yes, I addressed my concerns in the previous email.
13. In general, can the intelligence collection , target development , weaponeering process be improved
to mitigate collateral damage ?
This case, in my opinion, is not a failure of a process . I think the assumptions of the CDE methodology
are clearly stated. In cases where intelligence indicates a greater potential for secondary explosions ,
more consideration may be given to seek additional analysis, to seek strike approval through theb (11.4a

or to not strike the target if it were not of proportionally significant value.

1. (
21 July 2015, BGen Kevin J.Killea appointed me an
investigating officer (10) pursuant to AR 15-6 to conduct aninformal investigationinto the facts
and circumstances surrounding the authorization of a kinetic engagement conducted against a
VBIED (vehicle -borne improvisedexplosive device) factory in AlHawijah, Iraqon 02 June
2015. After careful review of allavailable evidence, I find that it is probable that the attack
resulted in civilian casualties but that the engagement was properly conducted under the Laws of

The variable that cannot be accounted for in CDM is secondary explosions because it may not be
possible to determine the type and quantity of explosives stored in VBIED or IED facilities and
the explosion results cannot be consistently measured or predicted.
Therefore , it should be

FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve
Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and partner forces have
liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh, eliminating their self -proclaimed
territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work
with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the
resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,706 strikes between August 2014 and the end of October 2019. During this period,
based on information available , CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,347 civilians have been unintentionally killed by
Coalition actions since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve . This number was reassessed in November
2019 to correct administrative errors and to accurately reflect the total number of credibly assessed civilian
casualties

We follow a rigidtargeting process for all ofour strikes to ensure strict adherence to the Law ofArmedConflict
while attemptingto avoidcollateral damage. Every accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to
take all feasible precautions to avoidputting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of October, CJTF-OIR carried over 73 open reports from previous months and received 63 new
reports. CJTF -OIR completed 49 civilian -casualty allegation assessment reports. Out of the 49 completed
casualty allegation reports, one report was determined to be credible and resulted in one unintentional civilian
death. CJTF -OIR assessed the remaining 46 reports as non-credible and two were duplicates of previous
reports. Additionally , there are two reports that had not previously been published that are addressed in this
report . Eighty-seven reports are still open, including one that CJTF-OIR had previously closed but reopened due
to the availability of new information.

The results of each investigationofan allegation will fall into one of two categories, either "credible" or "non
credible." An assessment of " credible" means that our team investigatedthe allegation and determined that,
based on available evidence, more likely than not, the deathwas the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluationmeans that the inform
we have to assess the allegation, using our available resources, cannot
determine, to the standard of "more likelythan not", that the death was the result of Coalition action. There
couldbe a numberofreasons for this, to includeno corroboratingstrikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficientor overly vague data in the
allegation itself.

a

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial quantity of data at its disposal to investigate
every claim , we welcome any information from any source that will enable us to determine the truth .

FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

U.S. Central Command announced the results of several civilian

TAMPA , Fla.
casualty assessments today. After a thorough review of the facts and
circumstances for each allegation, the preponderance of evidence indicates five
arate U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria , between April 12 and July 4 , have likely
resulted in the death of eight civilians and injuries to an additional three civilians .
We deeply regret the unintentional
airstrikes and express our deepest sympathies to the victims' families and those
affected

loss of life and injuries resulting from those

The Coalition takes all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties during the
course of military operations. In all of the cases released today , assessments
determined that although the air strikes complied with the law of armed conflict
and all appropriate precautions were taken , civilian casualties unfortunately did

We are sharing this information with the public as part of our commitment to
transparency. We continue to review additional claims of civilian casualties and
will provide additional information in the future.

Here is a description of the five U.S. strikes alleged to have resulted in civilian
casualties and determined to be credible :

1. On April 12 , 2015, near al Huwayjah , Iraq, during a strike on an ISIL tactical
unit, it was assessed that two unidentified civilians were killed .

2. On June 11, 2015, near Soluk, Syria, during strikes against an ISIL tactical unit,
it is assessed that three unidentified civilians were killed.

3. On June 19, 2015, near Tall alAdwaniyah, Syria, during a strike against two ISIL
vehicles, it is assessed that one civilian was injured when appearing in the target
area after the U.S. aircraft released its weapon .

4. On June 29 2015, near Haditha, Iraq, during strikes against one ISIL tactical
unit and two ISIL vehicles , it is assessed that two civilians were injured. After the
U.S. aircraft engaged the target and two seconds prior to impact, a car slowed in
front of the ISIL vehicles while a motorcycle simultaneously passed by. The target
vehicle was destroyed in the strike but there was insufficient evidence to
determine the level of injuries to the civilians operating the passing car and
motorcycle.

5. On July 4 , 2015 , near Ar Raqqah, Syria , during a strike against an ISIL High
Value Individual , a car and a motorcycle entered the target area after the weapon
was released . It is assessed that three unidentified civilians were likely killed.

Iraq and Syria CivilianCasualtyAssessments

Command announced the results of four more civilian casualty

TAMPA, Fla.
assessments today. After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances for each allegation,
the preponderance of evidence indicates four separate U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria, between
July 27 and Oct. 15, 2015, have likely resulted in the death of five civilians and injuries to an
additional eight civilians. We deeply regret the unintentional loss of life and injuries resulting
from those strikes and express our deepest sympathies to the victims ' families and those affected.

The Coalition takes all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties during the course of
military operations. In all of the cases released today, assessments determined that although the
strikes complied with the law of armed conflict and all appropriate precautions were taken,
civilian casualties unfortunately did occur.

We are sharingthis informationwith the publicas part ofour commitmentto transparency. We
continue to review additionalclaims ofciviliancasualtiesand will provide additional
informationin the future.

a

Here is a description of the four U.S. strikes alleged to have resulted in civilian casualties and
determined to be credible:

1. On July 27, 2015, near Ash Sharqat, Iraq, during strikes against ISIL vehicles, it was

assessed one civilian was injured.

2. OnAug. 13, 2015, near Ar Raqqah, Syria, during strikes against Junaid Hussain, an ISIL

cyber operative, it was assessed three civilians in the vicinity of the strikes were killed
and five more were injured.

3. On Sept. 24, 2015, near Sinjar, Iraq, during strikes against an ISIL vehicle, it was

assessed two civilians were killed. An assessed enemy combatant on a motorcycle was
targeted for engagement . Weapons were released while the target was stopped at an
intersection; however, another vehicle approached after weapons were in flight. Both the
motorcycle and the vehicle were destroyed .

4. On Oct. 15, 2015 near Tal Afar, Iraq, during strikes against ISIL Sharia Judge Mullah

Maysar, it was assessed two civilians were injured when the targeted vehicle veered into

April 30, 2017
Release # 20170430-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTASIA — During the month of March 2017, CJTF-OIR carried over 43
open reports of possible civilian casualties from previous months, received 27 new
reports, and completed the assessment on 28 reports resulting from Coalition strikes
in Iraq and Syria in the fight to defeat ISIS. Seventeen of these reports were
assessed to be non-credible, nine were assessed to be credible, and two reports
were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports. A total of 42 reports are still open
and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as ground
artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to promote a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date , based on data between August 2014 and March 2017 , the Coalition has
conducted a total of 20,205 strikes that included 42,089 separate engagements .
During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 396 .
The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was

102. The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian
casualties was .94%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report
of civilian casualties was
% . In last month's report this information was incorrectly
reported as February data , when in fact all but the strike numbers were accurate as of
31 March

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed that the following 17 reports are non-credible . Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties .

1. March 23, 2016 , near Hajj Ali, Iraq, via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was almost 4 km away.

June 18, 2016 , near Manbij , Syria , via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

3. Jan. 6, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq , via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted
in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties .

4. Jan. 14, 2017 , near Mosul , via NGO report: After a review of available information
and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

5. Jan. 15, 2017 , near Raqqah, Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

6. Jan. 17, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information
available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

7. Jan. 22, 2017, near Nayrab, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 30 km away.

8. Feb. 3 , 2017 , near DayrAz Zayr, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 35 km away.

9. Feb. 7 , 2017 , near Idlib, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 90 km away.

10. Feb. 14, 2017, near Mosul,
, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient
information available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

11. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . A
similar report of possible civilian casualties less than a kilometer away is still being
assessed .

12. Feb. 19, 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was approximately a
kilometer away. After a review of available information and strike video it was
assessed that there is insufficient information available to determine if civilians were
present or harmed in strikes in that area.

13. Feb. 20 , 2017 near Dayr Az Zayr , Syria , via social media report: No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

14. Feb. 20 , 2017, near Raqqah , Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

a

15. Feb. 22, 2017 near Tabqah , Syria, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

16. March 5 , 2017, near Raqqah, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

17. March 12, 2017 , near Maskana , Syria , via social media report No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner

that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Nine reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 45 civilians.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty.
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred .

In each of the incidents below , the investigation assessed that

1. Nov. 17, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on partnered forces from a building Nov. 18, it was assessed that eight civilians
were unintentionally killed and 12 civilians unintentionally injured in the building .

2. Dec. 11, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on Coalition and partnered forces , it was assessed that the strike impacted an
ISIS weapons cache that set off secondary explosions that set an adjacent building
on fire killing eight civilians in the building .

3. Feb. 9 , 2017 , near Al Qaim , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle , it was assessed that two civilians were unintentionally injured when
they entered the target area after the munition was released .

4. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on an ISIS
command and control node , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally
killed

5. Feb. 22 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in a
moving vehicle , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed when he

In February and March , the Coalition completed an audit of its civilian casualty report
tracking and reporting from August 2014 to the present. The audit determined that 10
previously released reports of civilian casualties were incorrectly reported resulting in
a net reduction of two civilians killed .

1. March 13, 2015, near Hatra, Iraq: On the Nov. 20, 2015, U.S. Central Command
press release it was reported that four civilians were killed during a strike on an ISIS
checkpoint. A subsequent investigation concluded that 11 civilians were
unintentionally killed.

2. Sept. 10 2015, in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit: Number 1 on the Apr. 22, 2016, U.S.
Central Command press release reported that two civilians were killed and four
injured during a strike on an ISIL checkpoint. This was incorrect, it was assessed that
four civilians were unintentionally killed and two injured.

3. Sept. 24, 2015, near Sinjar, Iraq: Number 3 on the Jan. 29, 2016, U.S. Central
Command press release it was reported that two civilians were killed during a strike
on an ISIS vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was
unintentionally killed.

4. June 21 , 2016 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria : Number 12 and 13 on the Nov. 9 , 2016 ,

U.S. Central Command press release were both based on the same report. The
actual assessment was that on June 21, 2016, near Ar Raqqah, during a strike on an
ISIS headquarters four civilians were unintentionally killed.

5. June 26, 2016, near Mosul, Iraq: Number 15 on the Nov. 9 , 2016, U.S Central
Command press release reported that one individual was injured after entering the
target area after the aircraft released its weapon. That was incorrect, it was assessed
that one civilian was unintentionally killed.

incorrect , it was assessed that the report of civilian casualties was non-credible .

10. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul ,
release reported that during a strike on ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle one civilian
was unintentionally killed. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one individual was
unintentionally injured .

Iraq: Number 5 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press

Additionally , it is assessed that 80 civilian casualties attributable to Coalition strikes to
defeat
ISIS in Iraq and Syria from August 2014 to the present had not previously been
announced .

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is more likely
than not, at least 352 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes
since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. We regret the unintentional loss of
civilian lives resultingfrom Coalition efforts to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and
express our deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

April 22 : CENTCOM releases Iraq and
Syria civilian casualty assessments

By / Published April 22, 2016

April 22, 2016
Release Number 20160422-09
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TAMPA, Fla. — U.S. Central Command announced the results of several civilian
casualty assessments today. After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances
for each allegation, the preponderance of evidence indicates nine separate U.S.
airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, between Sept. 10 2015 and Feb. 2, 2016, have likely
resulted in the death of 20 civilians and injuries to an additional 11 civilians. We
deeply regret the unintentional loss of life and injuries resulting from those strikes and
express our deepest sympathies to the victims' families and those affected.

The Coalition takes all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties during the
course of military operations. In allof the cases released today, assessments
determined that although the strikes complied with the law of armed conflict and all
appropriate precautions were taken, civilian casualties unfortunately did occur.

We are sharing this information with the public as part of our commitment to
transparency. We continue to review additional claims of civilian casualties and will
provide additional

information in the future .

Here is a description of the nine U.S. strikes alleged to have resulted in civilian
casualties and determined to be credible:

1. On Sept. 10 2015 , in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit, during a strike on an ISIL
checkpoint , it is assessed that two civilians were killed and four were injured when
their vehicle appeared in the target area after weapons were already in flight .

2. On Oct. 5 , 2015 , in Atshanah, Iraq, near Al Huwayjah, during a strike on ISIL
personnel, it is assessed that eight civilians were killed during a strike on a mortar fire
position used by enemy fighters.

3. On Nov. 4 , 2015, in Al Huwayjah, Iraq, during a strike on an ISIL vehicle, it is
assessed that two civilians were injured. The incident occurred when, after weapons
were already in flight , the ISIL vehicle unexpectedly pulled off the side of the road
near a building where two civilians were standing.

4. On Nov. 12 , 2015 in Ramadi , Iraq, during a strike targeting ISIL fighters,
assessed that one civilian was killed .

it is

5. On Dec. 10, 2015 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria , during strikes against Siful Sujan , an
ISIL external operations planner, it was assessed that one civilian was killed.

6. On Dec. 12, 2015, in Ramadi, Iraq, during a strike on ISIL personnel at a suspected
ISIL checkpoint, it is assessed that five civilians were killed after they unexpectedly
moved into the target location after weapons were already in flight.

7. On Dec. 24 , 2015 , in Tishreen , Syria , near Manbij, during a strike on two ISIL
fighters in a vehicle , it is assessed that one civilian on a motorcycle was killed riding
up to the target area after weapons were already in flight.

8. On Jan. 11, 2016 , near Mosul, Iraq , during a strike on five ISIL individuals guarding
an ISIL cash distribution station , it is assessed that one civilian was killed and five
were injured

9. On Feb. 2 , 2016 , in Al Ghazili , Syria , near Ayn Isa, during a strike on an ISIL
vehicle , it is assessed that one civilian was killed after unexpectedly driving into the
target area after weapons were already in flight .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

CENTRAL

April 22 : CENTCOM releases Iraq and
Syria civilian casualty assessments

By / Published April 22, 2016

April 22, 2016
Release Number 20160422-09
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TAMPA, Fla. — U.S. Central Command announced the results of several civilian
casualty assessments today. After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances
for each allegation, the preponderance of evidence indicates nine separate U.S.
airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, between Sept. 10 2015 and Feb. 2, 2016, have likely
resulted in the death of 20 civilians and injuries to an additional 11 civilians. We
deeply regret the unintentional loss of life and injuries resulting from those strikes and
express our deepest sympathies to the victims' families and those affected.

The Coalition takes all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties during the
course of military operations. In allof the cases released today, assessments
determined that although the strikes complied with the law of armed conflict and all
appropriate precautions were taken, civilian casualties unfortunately did occur.

We are sharing this information with the public as part of our commitment to
transparency. We continue to review additional claims of civilian casualties and will
provide additional

information in the future .

Here is a description of the nine U.S. strikes alleged to have resulted in civilian
casualties and determined to be credible:

1. On Sept. 10 2015 , in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit, during a strike on an ISIL
checkpoint , it is assessed that two civilians were killed and four were injured when
their vehicle appeared in the target area after weapons were already in flight .

2. On Oct. 5 , 2015 , in Atshanah, Iraq, near Al Huwayjah, during a strike on ISIL
personnel, it is assessed that eight civilians were killed during a strike on a mortar fire
position used by enemy fighters.

3. On Nov. 4 , 2015, in Al Huwayjah, Iraq, during a strike on an ISIL vehicle, it is
assessed that two civilians were injured. The incident occurred when, after weapons
were already in flight , the ISIL vehicle unexpectedly pulled off the side of the road
near a building where two civilians were standing.

4. On Nov. 12 , 2015 in Ramadi , Iraq, during a strike targeting ISIL fighters,
assessed that one civilian was killed .

it is

5. On Dec. 10, 2015 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria , during strikes against Siful Sujan , an
ISIL external operations planner, it was assessed that one civilian was killed.

6. On Dec. 12, 2015, in Ramadi, Iraq, during a strike on ISIL personnel at a suspected
ISIL checkpoint, it is assessed that five civilians were killed after they unexpectedly
moved into the target location after weapons were already in flight.

7. On Dec. 24 , 2015 , in Tishreen , Syria , near Manbij, during a strike on two ISIL
fighters in a vehicle , it is assessed that one civilian on a motorcycle was killed riding
up to the target area after weapons were already in flight.

8. On Jan. 11, 2016 , near Mosul, Iraq , during a strike on five ISIL individuals guarding
an ISIL cash distribution station , it is assessed that one civilian was killed and five
were injured

9. On Feb. 2 , 2016 , in Al Ghazili , Syria , near Ayn Isa, during a strike on an ISIL
vehicle , it is assessed that one civilian was killed after unexpectedly driving into the
target area after weapons were already in flight .

( U ) CAOC CIVCAS Credibility Assessment5 March 2016

(
After review of all available mission materials and open- source reporting
following the Coalition airstrike on a compound IVO Mosul, Iraq on or about 5 March 2016
(ATO RK), the CAOC assesses the CIVCAS allegations described below as CREDIBLE .

1.

2.

(U) CIVCAS Allegation Sources: Initial reports ofan American airstrike killing 18
civilians first appeared in a WebOps report, which cited two pro-ISIL sources . The first
source was a pro -ISIL media outlet, Ama’q News Agency ; the other, a pro- ISIL Twitter
user, named @altakriti6975. On 19 March 2016 , NRN News released several
photographs claimed to have been from the right side of Mosul”
civilian casualties. Some of these photos will be addressed later.

(U) Searches for @ altakriti6975one week after the initialreport yielded no findings.
The user account was no longer accessible on Twitter and any mention of the user was
unrelated to the CIVCAS allegation . A thorough search of open -source media utilized the

( U ) Sources searched:

(U ) Results of an open-source media search yielded an article in Airwars.org referencing
18-21 civilian deaths as a result of a strike on an abandoned industrial complex used by
ISIL (http://airwars.org/civcas-2016 ) . The article stated that in addition to 10 ISIL fighters
being killed in the strike, there were also 18-21 civilian deaths, specifically:

1. Ali Fathi Zeidan Al-Manaawi with wife
2. Hussein Ali Fathi Zeidan with wife and 6 children
3. Hassan Ali Fathi Zeidan with wife and 3 children
4. Ghazala Ali Fathi Zeidan with husband and 3 children
5. Daughter (unnamed) of Ali Fathi Zeidan (under 10 years old)

( U ) No further information was found for these named individuals . The Airwars.org
article goes on to say that the source for this information originated from the Nineveh
Reporters Network ( NRN) News. NRN News in an Iraq- based conglomeration of
independent reporters. They frequently report on Coalition airstrikes and CIVCAS
allegations . NRN News is not known to have any pro- ISIL affiliations and in fact, NRN
News has spoken out against ISIL at times. As of 19 March 2016, ISIL continues to

attempt to kidnap and punish NRN reporters and has been successful on occasion . The
primary method the NRN News relays stories are via social media ( e.g., Facebook). On 5
March 2016, NRN News relayed a Coalition airstrike had occurred in Mosul and updates
would continue to be relayed; however, this was the only mention of the airstrike on its
Facebook page . On 19 March 2016, photographs were found on the NRN News
page. The photos showed the bodies of several deceased and injured children .
Additionally , there were scenes from the site of the allegation, which will be addressed
later.

CentcomOfficials Release Iraq, Syria Civilian CasualtyAssessments
From a U.S. Central Command News Release

TAMPA , Fla., Nov. 9, 2016 – After months of reviewing reports and databases to resolve cases in which coalition
airstrikes may have resulted in civilian casualties , U.S. Central Command officials have determined that over the past
year, 24 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant may have killed as many as 64 civilians and
injured eight others in Iraq and Syria .

"We have teams who work full -time to prevent unintended civilian casualties ," Centcom
spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said .
A key tenet of the counter -ISIL air campaign is to avoid adding to the tragedy of the
situation by inflicting additional suffering, the colonel said.

" Sometimescivilians bear the brunt of military action,” he added, “ but we do all we can to
minimizethose occurrences, even at the cost of sometimesmissingthe chanceto strike
valid targets in real time. ”

CENTRAL

COMMAND

Thorough Review

Centcomthoroughlyreviewedthe facts and circumstancessurroundingeach report, officialssaid.

" The assessmentsdeterminedthat in each of these strikes, the right processeswere followed,” Thomas said. “ Each
compliedwith Law of Armed Conflict, and significantprecautionswere taken, despite the unfortunateoutcome."

Centcom officials said the investigations were informed by the military's own records, combined with an exhaustive
review of reports from outside sources from news media reports , nongovernmental organizations and other U.S.
government departments and agencies .

Thomassaid the numbersof casualtiesassociatedwith each individualairstrike reflectthe highest possible total
possible, accordingto the assessment.

" In most every case , when we determined there may have been civilian casualties from one of our airstrikes , we are
choosing to list the largest number of possible civilian casualties, he said . “ In cases where we just don't have the
investigative resources or evidence to determine precisely how many people may have died , we went with the
worst -case number to ensure a full accounting ."

List of ReviewedAirstrikes

Here are the 24 airstrikes officials reviewed, along with the casualty assessments :

CentcomOfficials Release Iraq, Syria Civilian CasualtyAssessments
From a U.S. Central Command News Release

TAMPA , Fla., Nov. 9, 2016 – After months of reviewing reports and databases to resolve cases in which coalition
airstrikes may have resulted in civilian casualties , U.S. Central Command officials have determined that over the past
year, 24 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant may have killed as many as 64 civilians and
injured eight others in Iraq and Syria .

"We have teams who work full -time to prevent unintended civilian casualties ," Centcom
spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said .
A key tenet of the counter -ISIL air campaign is to avoid adding to the tragedy of the
situation by inflicting additional suffering, the colonel said.

" Sometimescivilians bear the brunt of military action,” he added, “ but we do all we can to
minimizethose occurrences, even at the cost of sometimesmissingthe chanceto strike
valid targets in real time. ”

CENTRAL

COMMAND

Thorough Review

Centcomthoroughlyreviewedthe facts and circumstancessurroundingeach report, officialssaid.

" The assessmentsdeterminedthat in each of these strikes, the right processeswere followed,” Thomas said. “ Each
compliedwith Law of Armed Conflict, and significantprecautionswere taken, despite the unfortunateoutcome."

Centcom officials said the investigations were informed by the military's own records, combined with an exhaustive
review of reports from outside sources from news media reports , nongovernmental organizations and other U.S.
government departments and agencies .

Thomassaid the numbersof casualtiesassociatedwith each individualairstrike reflectthe highest possible total
possible, accordingto the assessment.

" In most every case , when we determined there may have been civilian casualties from one of our airstrikes , we are
choosing to list the largest number of possible civilian casualties, he said . “ In cases where we just don't have the
investigative resources or evidence to determine precisely how many people may have died , we went with the
worst -case number to ensure a full accounting ."

List of ReviewedAirstrikes

Here are the 24 airstrikes officials reviewed, along with the casualty assessments :

Casualty Report

Release # 20161201-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — During the month of October, CJTF-OIR received 18 reports
of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Twelve of these reports were determined to be non-credible, three
were determined to be credible, and three reports are still being assessed. Coalition
strikes are defined as strikes conducted by ground artillery or air strikes authorized as
part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all incidents
as thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to fully investigate all reports of
possible civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as
interviewing witnesses and examining the site , the Coalition interviews pilots, reviews
strike video when available, and analyzes information provided by government
agencies, non -governmental organizations, partner forces and traditional and social
media. In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order to
promote a thorough and continuous review process.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each alleged civilian
casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 12 reports received in October
are non-credible. Non-credible means that at this time there is not sufficient evidence
available to determine
, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in alleged
civilian casualties.

12. Oct. 6 , 2016, near Aleppo, Syria: No Coalition strikes were conducted on that

Although the Coalition makes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a
manner that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some cases casualties are
unavoidable. Four past reports of possible civilian casualties and three of the reports
received in October were determined to be credible resulting in the unintended death

of 54 civilians .

- MORE -

A credible assessment means that it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted
in a civilian casualty.
In each of the cases below, the investigation determined that
although all precautions were taken and the strikes complied with the Law of Armed
Conflict, civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1

March 31, 2016, near Sala Heya, Syria: During a strike on an ISIL mortar

system, it was assessed that three civilians were inadvertently killed by Coalition
counter-battery artillery near the point of origin of an ISIL mortar strike on friendly
forces.

May 16, 2016, near As Shaddadi , Syria: During a strike on seven ISIL fighters in

2 .
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that two civilians were inadvertently killed. One
civilian passenger in the vehicle was killed and one civilian riding a motorcycle was
killed when he came into proximity of the ISIL vehicle after the munition was released.

3 .
July 18, 2016 , near Manbij, Syria : During a strike that killed nearly 100 ISIL
fighters, and destroyed 13 fighting positions , seven ISIL vehicles , two VBIEDs , a
tactical vehicle, and a mortar system, it is assessed that up to 24 civilians who had
been interspersed with combatants were inadvertently killed in a known ISIL staging
area where no civilians had been seen in the 24 hours prior to the attack . Reports
indicated that approximately 100 ISIL fighters were preparing for a large counterattack
against partnered Syrian Arab Coalition/Syrian Democratic Forces and , unknown to
Coalition planners , civilians were moving around within the military staging area , even
as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days .

July 28 , 2016 , near Arghanndorh , Syria : During a strike on a moving ISIL

4 .
vehicle , 15 civilians were inadvertently killed when the munition struck the vehicle
after it slowed in a populated area after the munition was released .

5 .

Oct. 4 , 2016, nearTaltanah, Syria: During a strike targeting ISIL fighters it is

assessed that one civilian was inadvertently killed as a result of the blast following the
strike.

6 . Oct. 17, 2016 , near Idlib, Syria : During a strike on ISIL fighters it is assessed
that one civilian was inadvertently killed when he entered the target area after the
munition was released .

- MORE -

Oct. 22, 2016, near Fasitiyah, Iraq: During a strike on a building from which ISIL

7
fighters were firing on partnered Iraqi forces, eight civilians were inadvertently killed.

Currently, three reports received in October are still being assessed:

1 .

2 .

Oct. 6 , 2016 , near As Shaddadi , Syria .

Oct. 22, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

3 .

Oct. 23, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR has assessed it is more likely than
not that, since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, 173 civilians have been
inadvertently killed by Coalition strikes. We regret the unintentional loss of civilian
lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

CentcomOfficials Release Iraq, Syria Civilian CasualtyAssessments
From a U.S. Central Command News Release

TAMPA , Fla., Nov. 9, 2016 – After months of reviewing reports and databases to resolve cases in which coalition
airstrikes may have resulted in civilian casualties , U.S. Central Command officials have determined that over the past
year, 24 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant may have killed as many as 64 civilians and
injured eight others in Iraq and Syria .

"We have teams who work full -time to prevent unintended civilian casualties ," Centcom
spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said .
A key tenet of the counter -ISIL air campaign is to avoid adding to the tragedy of the
situation by inflicting additional suffering, the colonel said.

" Sometimescivilians bear the brunt of military action,” he added, “ but we do all we can to
minimizethose occurrences, even at the cost of sometimesmissingthe chanceto strike
valid targets in real time. ”

CENTRAL

COMMAND

Thorough Review

Centcomthoroughlyreviewedthe facts and circumstancessurroundingeach report, officialssaid.

" The assessmentsdeterminedthat in each of these strikes, the right processeswere followed,” Thomas said. “ Each
compliedwith Law of Armed Conflict, and significantprecautionswere taken, despite the unfortunateoutcome."

Centcom officials said the investigations were informed by the military's own records, combined with an exhaustive
review of reports from outside sources from news media reports , nongovernmental organizations and other U.S.
government departments and agencies .

Thomassaid the numbersof casualtiesassociatedwith each individualairstrike reflectthe highest possible total
possible, accordingto the assessment.

" In most every case , when we determined there may have been civilian casualties from one of our airstrikes , we are
choosing to list the largest number of possible civilian casualties, he said . “ In cases where we just don't have the
investigative resources or evidence to determine precisely how many people may have died , we went with the
worst -case number to ensure a full accounting ."

List of ReviewedAirstrikes

Here are the 24 airstrikes officials reviewed, along with the casualty assessments :

-- In a Nov. 20 , 2015 , strike against an ISIL tactical unit near Dayr Az Zawr, Syria, officials assessed that five civilians

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA – Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and partner
forces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh,
eliminating their self-proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh
oppression. The Coalition will continue to work with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical
space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,986 strikes between August 2014 and the end of May 2021 .
During this period , based on information available , CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,417 civilians
have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions since the beginning of Operation Inherent
Resolve

We follow a rigid targeting process for all of our strikes to ensure strict adherence to the Law of
Armed Conflict while attempting to avoid collateral damage. Every accidental loss of life is
tragic, and it will remain our goal to take all feasible precautions to avoid putting civilians in
danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of May , CJTF-OIR carried over 110 open reports from previous months and
received one new report. CJTF- OIR completed five civilian-casualty allegation assessment
reports. Out of the five completed casualty allegation reports, one report was determined to be
credible and resulted in seven unintentional civilian deaths . CJTF- OIR assessed the remaining
four reports as non- credible . 106 reports are still open , including one that CJTF-OIR had
previously closed but reopened due to the availability of new information .

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fallinto one of two categories , either
" credible " or " non -credible . " An assessment of " credible " means that our team investigated the
allegation and determined that , based on available evidence , more likely than not , the death
was the result of Coalition action. A " non - credible " evaluation means that the information we
have to assess the allegation , using our available resources, cannot determine , to the standard
of "more likely than not", that the death was the result of Coalition action. There
be a
number of reasons for this , to include no corroborating strikes at that time or that location ,
there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation , or there is simply insufficient or overly
vague data in the allegation itself.

CentcomOfficials Release Iraq, Syria Civilian CasualtyAssessments
From a U.S. Central Command News Release

TAMPA , Fla., Nov. 9, 2016 – After months of reviewing reports and databases to resolve cases in which coalition
airstrikes may have resulted in civilian casualties , U.S. Central Command officials have determined that over the past
year, 24 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant may have killed as many as 64 civilians and
injured eight others in Iraq and Syria .

"We have teams who work full -time to prevent unintended civilian casualties ," Centcom
spokesman Air Force Col. John J. Thomas said .
A key tenet of the counter -ISIL air campaign is to avoid adding to the tragedy of the
situation by inflicting additional suffering, the colonel said.

" Sometimescivilians bear the brunt of military action,” he added, “ but we do all we can to
minimizethose occurrences, even at the cost of sometimesmissingthe chanceto strike
valid targets in real time. ”

CENTRAL

COMMAND

Thorough Review

Centcomthoroughlyreviewedthe facts and circumstancessurroundingeach report, officialssaid.

" The assessmentsdeterminedthat in each of these strikes, the right processeswere followed,” Thomas said. “ Each
compliedwith Law of Armed Conflict, and significantprecautionswere taken, despite the unfortunateoutcome."

Centcom officials said the investigations were informed by the military's own records, combined with an exhaustive
review of reports from outside sources from news media reports , nongovernmental organizations and other U.S.
government departments and agencies .

Thomassaid the numbersof casualtiesassociatedwith each individualairstrike reflectthe highest possible total
possible, accordingto the assessment.

" In most every case , when we determined there may have been civilian casualties from one of our airstrikes , we are
choosing to list the largest number of possible civilian casualties, he said . “ In cases where we just don't have the
investigative resources or evidence to determine precisely how many people may have died , we went with the
worst -case number to ensure a full accounting ."

List of ReviewedAirstrikes

Here are the 24 airstrikes officials reviewed, along with the casualty assessments :

-- In a Nov. 20 , 2015 , strike against an ISIL tactical unit near Dayr Az Zawr, Syria, officials assessed that five civilians

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraq from
ISIS control began in 2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 83 % of ISIS-held
land to local populations and governance . The effort has liberated more than six million
Syrians and Iraqis.

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists , to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct
combat with a terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its
brutal three-year occupation.

a

Iraqi Security Forces, including more than 115,000 trained by Coalition partners, continue to
clear the last remaining pockets of ISIS in Hawija and western Anbar Province. The October
2016 to July 2017 battle to liberate Mosul reflects a significant sacrifice by our Iraqi partners,
who lost 1,200-1,500 personnel in action, with an approximate 8,000 more wounded.

The Syrian Democratic Forces , who continue to defeat ISIS in Dayr Az Zawr Province and
Raqqah, have suffered similarly in efforts to rid their nation of ISIS, with approximately 1100
troops killed and 3900 more wounded in the ongoing fight.

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and Syria take extraordinary care to protect the
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports
as thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the
site where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video , and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non-governmental reports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process.

In the month of August , CJTF-OIR carried over 455 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 80 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
( artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

During this period, the Coalition completed the assessment of 185 reports: 168 were
assessed to be non -credible, three were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and
14 were assessed to be credible , resulting in 50 unintentional civilian deaths . To date , based
on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 735 civilians have been unintentionally
killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 350 reports
are still open and being assessed at the end of the month.

The Coalition conducted a total of 26,026 strikes that included 53,948 separate engagements
between August 2014 and August 2017. During this period, the total number of reports of
possible civilian casualties was 1250. The total number of credible reports of civilian
casualties during this time period was 178. The percent of engagements that resulted in a
report of possible civilian casualties was 2.32% . The percent of engagements that resulted in
a credible report of civilian casualties was .33% .

Casualty Report

Release # 20170430-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTASIA — During the month of March 2017, CJTF-OIR carried over 43
open reports of possible civilian casualties from previous months, received 27 new
reports, and completed the assessment on 28 reports resulting from Coalition strikes
in Iraq and Syria in the fight to defeat ISIS. Seventeen of these reports were
assessed to be non-credible, nine were assessed to be credible, and two reports
were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports. A total of 42 reports are still open
and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as ground
artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to promote a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date , based on data between August 2014 and March 2017 , the Coalition has
conducted a total of 20,205 strikes that included 42,089 separate engagements .
During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 396 .
The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was

102. The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian
casualties was .94%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report
of civilian casualties was
% . In last month's report this information was incorrectly
reported as February data , when in fact all but the strike numbers were accurate as of
31 March

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed that the following 17 reports are non-credible . Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties .

1. March 23, 2016 , near Hajj Ali, Iraq, via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was almost 4 km away.

June 18, 2016 , near Manbij , Syria , via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

3. Jan. 6, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq , via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted
in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties .

4. Jan. 14, 2017 , near Mosul , via NGO report: After a review of available information
and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

5. Jan. 15, 2017 , near Raqqah, Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

6. Jan. 17, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information
available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

7. Jan. 22, 2017, near Nayrab, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 30 km away.

8. Feb. 3 , 2017 , near DayrAz Zayr, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.
The closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 35 km away.

9. Feb. 7 , 2017 , near Idlib, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 90 km away.

10. Feb. 14, 2017, near Mosul,
, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient
information available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

11. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . A
similar report of possible civilian casualties less than a kilometer away is still being
assessed .

12. Feb. 19, 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was approximately a
kilometer away. After a review of available information and strike video it was
assessed that there is insufficient information available to determine if civilians were
present or harmed in strikes in that area.

13. Feb. 20 , 2017 near Dayr Az Zayr , Syria , via social media report: No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

14. Feb. 20 , 2017, near Raqqah , Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

a

15. Feb. 22, 2017 near Tabqah , Syria, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were
conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties.

16. March 5 , 2017, near Raqqah, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

17. March 12, 2017 , near Maskana , Syria , via social media report No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner

that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Nine reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 45 civilians.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty.
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred .

In each of the incidents below , the investigation assessed that

1. Nov. 17, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on partnered forces from a building Nov. 18, it was assessed that eight civilians
were unintentionally killed and 12 civilians unintentionally injured in the building .

2. Dec. 11, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on Coalition and partnered forces , it was assessed that the strike impacted an
ISIS weapons cache that set off secondary explosions that set an adjacent building
on fire killing eight civilians in the building .

3. Feb. 9 , 2017 , near Al Qaim , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle , it was assessed that two civilians were unintentionally injured when
they entered the target area after the munition was released .

4. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on an ISIS
command and control node , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally
killed

5. Feb. 22 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in a
moving vehicle , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed when he
entered the target area after the munition was released .

6. Feb. 27, 2017 , near Al Qaim, Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally killed and one
civilian unintentionally injured
another moving vehicle that came into the proximnity
of the target vehicle at the time of the attack .

7. March 1, 2017, near Mosul
VBIED factory, it was assessed that the strike blast set off a secondary explosion of
an ISIS VBIED parked next to a house down the street from the target location
resulting in the unintentional death of 14 civilians.

Iraq, via media report: During a strike on an ISIS

8. March 3 , 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on an ISIS

In February and March , the Coalition completed an audit of its civilian casualty report
tracking and reporting from August 2014 to the present. The audit determined that 10
previously released reports of civilian casualties were incorrectly reported resulting in
a net reduction of two civilians killed .

1. March 13, 2015, near Hatra, Iraq: On the Nov. 20, 2015, U.S. Central Command
press release it was reported that four civilians were killed during a strike on an ISIS
checkpoint. A subsequent investigation concluded that 11 civilians were
unintentionally killed.

2. Sept. 10 2015, in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit: Number 1 on the Apr. 22, 2016, U.S.
Central Command press release reported that two civilians were killed and four
injured during a strike on an ISIL checkpoint. This was incorrect, it was assessed that
four civilians were unintentionally killed and two injured.

3. Sept. 24, 2015, near Sinjar, Iraq: Number 3 on the Jan. 29, 2016, U.S. Central
Command press release it was reported that two civilians were killed during a strike
on an ISIS vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was
unintentionally killed.

4. June 21 , 2016 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria : Number 12 and 13 on the Nov. 9 , 2016 ,

U.S. Central Command press release were both based on the same report. The
actual assessment was that on June 21, 2016, near Ar Raqqah, during a strike on an
ISIS headquarters four civilians were unintentionally killed.

5. June 26, 2016, near Mosul, Iraq: Number 15 on the Nov. 9 , 2016, U.S Central
Command press release reported that one individual was injured after entering the
target area after the aircraft released its weapon. That was incorrect, it was assessed
that one civilian was unintentionally killed.

6. July 14, 2016, near Qayyarah ,
Command press release reported that one civilian was killed during a strike on an
ISIS-held building . That was incorrect,

7. Oct. 4 , 2016, near Talatanah, Syria : Number 5 on the Dec. 1, 2016, CJTF-OIR
press release reported that one civilian was killed during a strike on ISIS fighters.
That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally injured.

8. Nov. 6 , 2016, near Shahid-Yunis As Sab, Iraq Number 1 on the Jan 2 , 2017,
CJTF-OIR press release reported that seven civilians were killed during a strike on
ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that two
civilians were unintentionally killed and five injured.

9. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq : Number 4 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press
release reported that one civilian was unintentionally injured in a house . That was
incorrect , it was assessed that the report of civilian casualties was non-credible .

10. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul ,
release reported that during a strike on ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle one civilian
was unintentionally killed. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one individual was
unintentionally injured .

Iraq: Number 5 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press

Additionally , it is assessed that 80 civilian casualties attributable to Coalition strikes to
defeat
ISIS in Iraq and Syria from August 2014 to the present had not previously been
announced .

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is more likely
than not, at least 352 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes
since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. We regret the unintentional loss of
civilian lives resultingfrom Coalition efforts to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and
express our deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

was directed to shift to this grid in order to search for the weapons system . After finding
the Mortar POO site , and watching it actively fire at friendly forces, the TEA authorized a
strike against the site under collective self-defense of the ISF. During the engagement ,
transient scans were conducted noting several unarmed individuals in the area . Three
unarmed individuals were associating with the mortar site and were assessed to be ISIL
based on their interactions , that is, they were using the mortar tube (demonstrating both
hostile intent and acts ).
initial battle damage assessment was one mortar tube destroyed, one enemy KIA , and

( 1) For the first 4:00 of the video , three adult males are seen interacting with the
Mortar POO site , which is partially hidden from sight by the trees . The grid coordinate
on the video indicates that this mortar site is the same that had been observed by

the previous 30 minutes . At 3:48 and 4:03 , two men are seen leaving the
Mortar POO site , and traveling in a north -by -northwest direction towards a building , and
returning to the Mortar POO site .

(2 ) At 4:35, two unidentified individuals pass from north to south on the sidewalk
site. Additionally, three unidentified individualsare across the

nearest the Mortar
street heading in the same direction.

(3) The two individuals who left the Mortar POO site, return to the same place
they left around 4:57. Additionally, three unidentified individuals are across the street
heading almost directly south and a motor bike drives by from south to north. At this
time, there appears to be at least 11 unidentified individuals and two assessed ISIL in a
500m ring around the Mortar POO site.

(4 ) At approximately 05:11, splash occurs on the Mortar POO site. Multiple

unidentified individuals are seen running from the streets . At 5:53 , two individuals are
across the street near a white vehicle with one laying on the ground. At 6:17, one
individual associated with the Mortar POO site is attended to by another, also from the
Mortar POO site . The third adult male associated with the Mortar POO site is visible on
the screen and appears KIA. Although the footage moves around a lot, it appears that
one person who was walking on the adjacent sidewalk and one of the adult males
associated with the Mortar POO site are carried to the southern intersection and
transported away by an unknown vehicle .

Operation Inherent Resolve

Release # 20170202-02
FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA- During the month of December 2016 , CJTF-OIR received 12 new reports and
assessed 11 reports of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Coalition strikes are defined as ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the
Coalition Air Tasking Order.

-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses reports as thoroughly as possible.

Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible civilian casualties using traditional
investigative methods, such as by interviewing witnesses and examining the site, we do interview pilots
and other personnel involved in targeting decisions, review aircraft video if available , and analyze
information provided by government agencies, non - governmental organizations, partner forces and
traditional and social media In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order
to promote a thorough and continuous review process .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each report, CJTF- OIR assessed that the
following seven reports are non-credible at this time. An assessment that a report is non-credible means
that there is not sufficient evidence available to determine whether, more likely than not, a Coalition strike
resulted in the reported civilian casualties .

1. Feb. 15, 2016, Hama Province, Syria, via social media report: Date correction. This report was

previously incorrectly released as Feb. 2, 2016 in the Jan. 2, 2016 monthly report. No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

2. July 20 , 2016, near Manbij, Syria, via social media report: This report of civilian casualties was assessed

to be a duplicate of a previous report released as July 18, 2016, near Manbij, Syria, in the Dec. 1, 2016,
monthly report

3. Oct. 6, 2016, near Al Shadadi Syria, via self -report: After a review of available information and strike

a

video it was assessed that no civilians were harmed in this strike.

5. Dec. 1, 2016, near Al

Iraq, via social media report: After a review of available information it was
assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted in this geographic area that correspond to the report of
civilian casualties.

a

Dec. 7 2016, nearAl Qa'im Iraq, via social media report After a review ofavailableinformationit was

a

the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

8. Dec. 29 2016, near Mosul Iraq, via self - report: After a review of available information and strike video

a

it was assessed that no civilians were harmed in this

.

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner that minimizes the
risk to civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are unavoidable. Four reports were assessed to be
credible resulting in the unintended death of 11 civilians. A credible assessment means that, it is more
likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted ina civilian casualty. Ineach of the reports below, it was
assessed that even though feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the Law
of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1. Oct. 25 , 2016, near Mosul Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIL fighters in a moving vehicle it is

assessed that one civilian was unintentionallykilledwhen the target vehicle passedhis locationat the
time of the munition'simpact.

2. Dec. 3 , 2016, nearMosul Iraq, via self-report: Duringa strike on ISIL fighters firing a mortar on

previously released as Nov. 24, 2016, near Omar Gosp , Syria in the Jan. 2 , 2016, monthly report.

To date , based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is more likely than not, at least 199
civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve.
We regret the unintentional loss of civilian lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and
Syria and express our deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Jan. 10, 2020

the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and

SOUTHWESTASIA
partnerforces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,725 strikes between August 2014 and the end of
November 2019. During this period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR
assesses at least 1,359 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions
since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigid targeting process for allof our strikes to ensure strict adherence to
the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to avoid collateral damage. Every
accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to take all feasible
precautions to avoid putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of November, CJTF-OIR carried over 87 open reports from previous
months and received 47 new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 52 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports. Out of the 52 completed casualty allegation reports,
four reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 12 unintentional civilian
deaths. CJTF-OIR assessed the remaining 48 reports as non-credible. 82 reports are
still open, including three that CJTF-OIR had previously closed but reopened due to
the availability of new information.

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one of two categories,
either " credible" or " non - credible ." An assessment of " credible " means that our team

investigated the allegation and determined that, based on available evidence, more
likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluation means that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our
available resources, cannot determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that
the death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number of reasons for
this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly
vague data in the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial quantity of data at its
disposal to investigate every claim , we welcome any information from any source that
will enable us to determine the truth . Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain more accurate
results .

Credible Reports: in the four incidents assessed as credible in November, the
investigations assessed that CJTF-OIR took all feasible precautions, and the decision
to strike complied with the law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be
precise during the planning and execution of strikes to reduce the risk of harm to
civilians. Numeric Key:

CJTF -OIR Monthly Civilian Casualty

By CJTF-OIR PAO / Published Nov. 30, 2017
SOUTHWEST ASIA – The Coalition is constantly improving its visibility on and
accountability for allegations. From October through early November, the Coalition Civilian
Casualty Assessment Team traveled throughout the region and reviewed procedures and
processes to increase efficiency of assessments. The team also trained approximately 30
members of Coalition components inthe assessment process to ensure allegations of civilian
casualties are addressed as quickly as possible. We continue to hold ourselves accountable for
actions that may have caused unintentional injury or death to civilians.

take extraordinary care to protect the

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the site
where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video, and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non -governmentalreports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process. At times, we have re-opened investigations in light of new evidence .

Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraqfrom ISIS control began in
2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 96% of ISIS-held land to local populations
and governance , liberating approximately 7.5 million Syrians and Iraqis .

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering

The Coalition is extremely concerned about explosive remnants of war that still pose a threat
to returning civilians in areas cleared of Daesh . The United States has invested $333 million
toward the clearance and safe disposal of landmines , unexploded ordnance (UXO), and

removal ofnearly 40,000 kilograms of explosives since April2016 from liberated areas in
Iraq, according to the State Department'sOffice of Weapons Removal and Abatement.

The Coalition also remains committed to training partner forces in
bomb disposal units that efficiently disarm dangerous traps left by ISIS in order to provide a
safe and secure environment for their people. The Coalition and our partners have taken
significant steps to protect innocent lives, and we will continue to do so .

Casualty Report

Published April 30 , 2017

April 30, 2017
Release # 20170430-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTASIA — During the month of March 2017, CJTF-OIR carried over 43
open reports of possible civilian casualties from previous months, received 27 new
reports, and completed the assessment on 28 reports resulting from Coalition strikes
in Iraq and Syria in the fight to defeat ISIS. Seventeen of these reports were
assessed to be non-credible, nine were assessed to be credible, and two reports
were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports. A total of 42 reports are still open
and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as ground
artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to promote a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date , based on data between August 2014 and March 2017 , the Coalition has
conducted a total of 20,205 strikes that included 42,089 separate engagements .
During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 396 .
The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was

102. The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian
casualties was .94%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report
of civilian casualties was
% . In last month's report this information was incorrectly
reported as February data , when in fact all but the strike numbers were accurate as of
31 March

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed that the following 17 reports are non-credible . Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties .

1. March 23, 2016 , near Hajj Ali, Iraq, via NGO report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was almost 4 km away.

conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

3. Jan. 6, 2017 , near Mosul, Iraq , via social media report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted
in this geographic area that correspond to the report of civilian casualties .

4. Jan. 14, 2017 , near Mosul , via NGO report: After a review of available information
and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to
determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

5. Jan. 15, 2017 , near Raqqah, Syria , via social media report: After a review of
available information it was assessed that there is insufficient information available to

9. Feb. 7 , 2017 , near Idlib, Syria, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The
closest strike to the report of possible civilian casualties was 90 km away.

10. Feb. 14, 2017, near Mosul,
, via social media report: After a review of
available information and strike video it was assessed that there is insufficient
information available to determine if civilians were present or harmed in this strike .

11. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties . A
similar report of possible civilian casualties less than a kilometer away is still being
assessed .

12. Feb. 19, 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were
conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties. The

a

15. Feb. 22, 2017 near Tabqah , Syria, via social media report: After a review of

conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

17. March 12, 2017 , near Maskana , Syria , via social media report No Coalition
strikes were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian
casualties

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner

that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Nine reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 45 civilians.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty.
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred .

In each of the incidents below , the investigation assessed that

1. Nov. 17, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on partnered forces from a building Nov. 18, it was assessed that eight civilians
were unintentionally killed and 12 civilians unintentionally injured in the building .

2. Dec. 11, 2016 , near Mosul , Iraq, via NGO report: During a strike on ISIS fighters
firing on Coalition and partnered forces , it was assessed that the strike impacted an
ISIS weapons cache that set off secondary explosions that set an adjacent building
on fire killing eight civilians in the building .

3. Feb. 9 , 2017 , near Al Qaim , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIS fighters in
a moving vehicle , it was assessed that two civilians were unintentionally injured when
they entered the target area after the munition was released .

4. Feb. 19, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on an ISIS
command and control node , it was assessed that one civilian was unintentionally

of the target vehicle at the time of the attack .

7. March 1, 2017, near Mosul
VBIED factory, it was assessed that the strike blast set off a secondary explosion of
an ISIS VBIED parked next to a house down the street from the target location
resulting in the unintentional death of 14 civilians.

Iraq, via media report: During a strike on an ISIS

8. March 3 , 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via self-report: During a strike on an ISIS

In February and March , the Coalition completed an audit of its civilian casualty report
tracking and reporting from August 2014 to the present. The audit determined that 10
previously released reports of civilian casualties were incorrectly reported resulting in
a net reduction of two civilians killed .

1. March 13, 2015, near Hatra, Iraq: On the Nov. 20, 2015, U.S. Central Command
press release it was reported that four civilians were killed during a strike on an ISIS
checkpoint. A subsequent investigation concluded that 11 civilians were
unintentionally killed.

2. Sept. 10 2015, in Kubaysah, Iraq, near Hit: Number 1 on the Apr. 22, 2016, U.S.
Central Command press release reported that two civilians were killed and four
injured during a strike on an ISIL checkpoint. This was incorrect, it was assessed that
four civilians were unintentionally killed and two injured.

3. Sept. 24, 2015, near Sinjar, Iraq: Number 3 on the Jan. 29, 2016, U.S. Central
Command press release it was reported that two civilians were killed during a strike
on an ISIS vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one civilian was
unintentionally killed.

4. June 21 , 2016 , near Ar Raqqah , Syria : Number 12 and 13 on the Nov. 9 , 2016 ,

U.S. Central Command press release were both based on the same report. The
actual assessment was that on June 21, 2016, near Ar Raqqah, during a strike on an
ISIS headquarters four civilians were unintentionally killed.

5. June 26, 2016, near Mosul, Iraq: Number 15 on the Nov. 9 , 2016, U.S Central
Command press release reported that one individual was injured after entering the
target area after the aircraft released its weapon. That was incorrect, it was assessed
that one civilian was unintentionally killed.

ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle. That was incorrect, it was assessed that two

9. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq : Number 4 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press
release reported that one civilian was unintentionally injured in a house . That was
incorrect , it was assessed that the report of civilian casualties was non-credible .

10. Jan. 4 , 2017 , near Mosul ,
release reported that during a strike on ISIS fighters in a moving vehicle one civilian
was unintentionally killed. That was incorrect, it was assessed that one individual was
unintentionally injured .

Iraq: Number 5 on the March 4 , 2017 , CJTF-OIR press

Additionally , it is assessed that 80 civilian casualties attributable to Coalition strikes to
defeat
ISIS in Iraq and Syria from August 2014 to the present had not previously been
announced .

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is more likely
than not, at least 352 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes
since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. We regret the unintentional loss of
civilian lives resultingfrom Coalition efforts to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and
express our deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

Casualty Report

Release # 20170602-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — In the month of April , CJTF-OIR received 43 new reports of
possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in support of partnered
force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria . During this period , the Coalition
completed the assessment of 47 reports, of which 31 were assessed to be non
credible and 16 were assessed to be credible resulting in 132 unintentional civilian
deaths . To date , based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses that , it is more
likely than not , at least 484 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve . A total of 38 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month . Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

government agencies, non-governmental

To date, based on data between August 2014 and April2017, the Coalition conducted

a total of 21,035 strikes that included 44,330 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 440. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 118. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
.99%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was .27%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 31 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Sixteen reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the
unintentional death of 132 civilians.
A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although allfeasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.
1. Jan. 31, 2017, near Dayr Az Zayr, Syria, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and
partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self-proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition willcontinue to work with partner

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations
as well as new or compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability
based on the best available evidence.

The Coalition conducted 34,464 strikes between August 2014 and end of March
2019. During this period, based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses at least
1291 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the beginning
of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In the month of March, CJTF- OIR carried over 146 open reportsfrom previous

months and received seven new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 31 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports; including two that had been previously closed but
were reopened with the availability of new information. Out of the 31 completed
casualty allegation reports, 11 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in
34 unintentional civilian deaths. One of the reports was determined to be a duplicate
report and the remaining 19 reports were assessed to be non-credible. One hundred
and twenty two reports are still open, including three that had been previously closed
but were reopened due to the availability of new information.

Credible Reports --In these 11 incidents , the investigation assesses that the Coalition
took all feasible precautions and the decision to strike complied with the law of armed
conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be precise during the planning and
execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians .

Report

CJTF -OIR Monthly Civilian Casualty

By CJTF-OIR PAO / Published Nov. 30, 2017
SOUTHWEST ASIA – The Coalition is constantly improving its visibility on and
accountability for allegations. From October through early November, the Coalition Civilian
Casualty Assessment Team traveled throughout the region and reviewed procedures and
processes to increase efficiency of assessments. The team also trained approximately 30
members of Coalition components inthe assessment process to ensure allegations of civilian
casualties are addressed as quickly as possible. We continue to hold ourselves accountable for
actions that may have caused unintentional injury or death to civilians.

take extraordinary care to protect the

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the site
where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video, and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non -governmentalreports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process. At times, we have re-opened investigations in light of new evidence .

Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraqfrom ISIS control began in
2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 96% of ISIS-held land to local populations
and governance , liberating approximately 7.5 million Syrians and Iraqis .

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists, to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct combat
with the terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its brutal
three- year occupation.

a

The Coalition is extremely concerned about explosive remnants of war that still pose a threat
to returning civilians in areas cleared of Daesh . The United States has invested $333 million
toward the clearance and safe disposal of landmines , unexploded ordnance (UXO), and

securing excess conventional weapons and munitions in Iraq since 2003. This includes the
removal ofnearly 40,000 kilograms of explosives since April2016 from liberated areas in
Iraq, according to the State Department'sOffice of Weapons Removal and Abatement.

The Coalition also remains committed to training partner forces in
bomb disposal units that efficiently disarm dangerous traps left by ISIS in order to provide a
safe and secure environment for their people. The Coalition and our partners have taken
significant steps to protect innocent lives, and we will continue to do so .

capabilities such as

In the month of October, CJTF-OIR carried over 519 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 240 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
(artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria .

During this period, the Coalition completed the assessment of 64 reports: 55 were assessed to
be non-credible , four were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and five were

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and
partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self-proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition willcontinue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to

We continue
minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This
process includes thorough review and vetting of each target package prior to a strike
and another review after that strike. Our regular strike reports make our activities
publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes our
civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

a

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations
as well as new or compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability
based on the best available evidence.

The Coalition conducted 34,464 strikes between August 2014 and end of March
2019. During this period, based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses at least
1291 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the beginning
of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In the month of March, CJTF- OIR carried over 146 open reportsfrom previous

months and received seven new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 31 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports; including two that had been previously closed but
were reopened with the availability of new information. Out of the 31 completed
casualty allegation reports, 11 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in
34 unintentional civilian deaths. One of the reports was determined to be a duplicate
report and the remaining 19 reports were assessed to be non-credible. One hundred
and twenty two reports are still open, including three that had been previously closed
but were reopened due to the availability of new information.

Credible Reports --In these 11 incidents , the investigation assesses that the Coalition
took all feasible precautions and the decision to strike complied with the law of armed
conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be precise during the planning and
execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians .

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

By CJTF-OIR PAO / Published Sept. 27, 2018
SOUTHWEST ASIA-- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since
2014 to defeat ISIS in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million
Iraqis and Syrians from ISIS's brutal rule and reducing its control of territory to
approximately one percent of what it previously held .

We continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to
minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This
process includes thorough review and vetting of each target package prior to a strike ,
and another review after that strike. Our regular strike reports make our activities
publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes our
civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations
as well as new or compelling evidence on past allegationsto establish accountability
based on the best available evidence

The Coalition conducted a total of 30,008 strikes between August 2014 and end of
August 2018. During this period, based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses
at least 1114 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the
start of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In the month of August, CJTF-OIR carried over 219* open reports from previous
months and received 151 new reports. The assessment of 60 civilian casualty reports
has been completed. Out of the 60 completed casualty reports, eight of the reports
were determined to be credible and resulted in 53 unintentional civilian deaths. Two of
the reports were determined to be duplicate reports that had previously reported and
the rer
ning 50 reports were assessed to be non-credible. A total of 310 reports are

still open.

Credible Reports-- In each of eight incidents, the investigation assessed that although
all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the law of
armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties regrettably occurred.

1. August 13, 2016, near Qayyarah, Iraq, via media report. During a strike on ISIS
headquarters and fighting positions six civilians were unintentionally killed .

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Feb. 13, 2020

the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and

SOUTHWESTASIA
partnerforces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,763 strikes between August 2014 and the end of
December 2019. During this period , based on information available, CJTF-OIR
assesses at least 1,370 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions
since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigid targeting process for allof our strikes to ensure strict adherence to
the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to avoid collateral damage. Every
accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to take all feasible
precautions to avoid putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of December, CJTF-OIR carried over 82 open reports from previous
months and received 41 new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 45 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports. Out of the 45 completed casualty allegation reports,
three reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 11 unintentional civilian
deaths. CJTF-OIR
the remaining 41 reports as non-credible and one was a
duplicate of a previous report. Seventy-nine reports are still open , including three that
CJTF-OIR had previously closed but reopened due to the availability of new
information

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one of two categories ,

either " credible" or " non -credible." An assessment of " credible" means that our team
investigated the allegation and determined that, based on available evidence, more
likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible"
evaluation means that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our
available resources, cannot determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that
the death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number of reasons for
this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly
vague data in the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial quantity of data at its
disposal to investigate every claim , we welcome any information from any source that
will enable us to determine the truth . Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain more accurate
results .

a

Credible Reports: In the three incidents assessed as credible in December, the
investigations assessed that the CJTF-OIR took all feasible precautions , and the
decision to strike complied with the law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work
diligently to be precise during the planning and execution of strikes to reduce the risk
of harm to civilians. Numeric Key: [CJTF -

Release # 20171228-01
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA - Over the past month , Iraqi Security Forces conducted multiple
operations to ensure the security of their people, land and borders. These operations
included clearance of desert areas where Daesh was hiding after fleeing ISF
operations in populated areas. ISF also conducted successful clearing and security
operations in Mosul, Tal Afar, Hawijah and Baghdad, and operations are still ongoing
in Salah al-Din.

After more than three years of hard fighting, the government of Iraq declared the
liberation of former Daesh-controlled areas Dec. 10. The following day, Iraqi Security
Forces linked up with Syrian Democratic Forces at the border near Al Qaim , Iraq,
demonstrating each force's intent to provide security in border regions, enabling
commerce and travel while preventing Daesh terrorists from continuing to flee the
battlefield

Despite a string of successes by Iraqi Security Forces and Syrian Democratic Forces,
much work remains to ensure the enduring defeat of Daesh. The terrorist organization
is still attempting to re-establish regional networks and remains a regional and global
threat through its ability to organize or inspire acts of violence against innocent people
around the world .

In Syria , the Coalition and our SDF partners continue to decisively engage large
groups of terrorists in the Middle Euphrates River Valley and southern Syria . Over the
past month , there were two reported incidents of groups of terrorists crossing from

regime-controlled area into Coalition -controlled areas of southern Syria . In both
events , the Coalition and our SDF
Daesh terrorists .

decisively engaged the threat and killed

Although increased security resulted in historic low Coalition strike numbers in
November and December, Daesh has demonstrated both its ability and its intent to
reorganize and attack the Iraqi and Syrian people. The Coalition will thus continue to
support our partners' operations to defeat Daesh and prevent its resurgence.

In the month of November, CJTF-OIR carried over 695 open reports of possible
civilian casualties from previous months and received 9 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria .

During this period , the Coalition completed the assessment of 101 reports: 92 were
assessed to be non-credible, none were assessed to be duplicates of previous
reports, and nine were assessed to be credible, resulting in 11 unintentional civilian
deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 817
civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of
Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 603 reports are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,562 strikes that included 57,336 separate
engagements between August 2014 and November 2017.During this period, the total
number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,799. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 208. The percent of
engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was 3.13 . The
percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian casualties was
.36%

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 92 reports as non-credible : at this time there
is insufficient information to assess that , more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Nine reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 11civilians. The Coalition also added five unintentional civilian deaths from
past reports previously excluded from the count.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the law of armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve is
committed to working by, with and through our Iraqi Security Forces and Syrian
Democratic Forces partners to defeat Daesh in designated parts of Iraq and Syria,
and helping set the conditions for follow -on operations to increase regional stability.

CJTF-OIR provides our partners appropriate equipment, advice and assistance to
achieve our mission and attain the lasting defeat of Daesh. Support to partners also
includes precision strikes preceded by a rigorous targeting process that aims at all
times to minimize effects on non-combatant populations and civilian infrastructure.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,358 strikes between August 2014 and end of
April2018. During this period, based on information available , CJTF -OIR assesses at
least 892 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start
of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In the month of April, CJTF-OIR carried over 476 open reportsfrom previous months
and received

four new reports. The assessment of 159 civilian casualty reports have been
completed. Five reports were determined to be credible , resulting in nine unintentional
civilian deaths, while 149 were assessed to be non-credible and five to be duplicate.
A total of 321 reports are still open.

Credible Reports-- In each of five incidents , the investigation assessed that although
all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the law of
armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties regrettably occurred .

1. January 9 , 2017, near Mosul, Iraq, via media report. During a strike which
destroyed Daesh vehicle-borne improvised explosive device used to attack Coalition
and partner forces two civilians were unintentionally killed .

2. November 1, 2017 , near Al Hiri village , Deir Ezzour, Syria via self-report. During a

5. January 18, 2018 , near Abu Kamal , Syria , via self -report. During a strike on Daesh
held building a scooter entered the impact area moments before the impact . One
civilian was unintentionally killed.

Non Credible Reports After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of
each civilian casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed the following 149 reports as non
credible . At this time there is insufficient information to assess that, more likely than
not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CombinedJoint Task Force- OperationInherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since 2014 to defeat
Daesh in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million Iraqis and Syrians from Daesh's
brutal rule.

Throughout our air and ground campaigns, we have used deliberate targeting and strike processes to
minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. Our assessments of
civilian casualties are transparent , and we hold ourselves accountable through regularly published strike
press releases and civilian casualty reports.

We are willing to work with all who bring allegations of civilian casualties to us, and we seek new or
additional information or evidence through public sources , eyewitness accounts or self-reports. We have
demonstrated willingness to re-assess past cases in the face of new or compelling evidence .

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,826 strikes between August 2014 and end of June 2018. During this
period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 1059 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve.

This month's civilian casualty total reflects the re- addition of 15 casualties from a credible report carried in
the April 2018 reports that was mistakenly left out ofthe May 2018 report.

a

In the month of June, CJTF- OIR carried over 314 open reports from previous months and received 45 new
reports. The assessment of 125 civilian casualty reports have been completed. Sixteen reports were
determined to be credible , resulting in 105 unintentional civilian deaths, while three were assessed to be
duplicate and 106 were assessed to be non-credible . A total of 234 reports are still open.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- During the month of February the Coalition and our partners
continued the fight to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh. The Coalition and our
partners have liberated over 98
liberated 7.7 million Iraqis and Syrians once held under brutal Daesh rule. However,
much work still needs to be done to ensure the lasting defeat of the terrorist, criminal
organization

of the area formerly controlled by Daesh, and have

In February the Iraqi Security Forces continue to take the fight to Daesh terrorists
hiding among the people of Iraq. The ISF conducted multiple operations to secure
their country, people and borders. The security they provide enables the international
community to support non military stabilization operations and assist in the return to
normal life for the Iraqi people who

hope for a better life after Daesh.

Syrian Democratic Forces and Coalition partners continued operations to destroy
remnants of Daesh in Syria. SDF's successes and continued efforts to remove
terrorists from the battlefield and deny Daesh safe haven have been a benefit to the
world preventing the regional and global spread of a hateful ideology that actively
seeks to target our homes and our populations.

a

The SDF's presence in Syria continues to reap dividends as they detain terrorists
trying to escape the region. The SDF are instrumental in removing Daesh's most
violent terrorists from the battlefield as they try to flee

In the month of February, CJTF-OIR carried over 485 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 121 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat Daesh
in Iraq and Syria .

During this period, the Coalition completed the assessment of 84: 78 were assessed
to be non-credible, none were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and six
were assessed to be credible, resulting in 14 unintentional civilian deaths. To date,
based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 855 civilians have been
unintentionallykilled by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent
Resolve. A total of 522 reports are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,225 strikes between August 2014 and end of
February 2018. During this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian
casualties was 2,135 . The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during
this time period was 224 .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 78 reports as non-credible : at this time there
is insufficient information to assess that , more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

A finding of non-credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. "Non -credible" is
not intended to deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred, nor is it intended
as a comment on the credibility on the source of the allegation.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since 2014 to defeat
Daesh in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million Iraqis and Syrians from Daesh's
brutal rule and reducing its control of territory to approximately one percent of what it previously held.

We continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of
our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This process includes thorough review and
vetting of each target package prior to a strike, and another review after that strike . Our regular strike
reports make our activities publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports
makes our civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to considernew civilian casualtyallegationsas well as new or
compellingevidence on past allegationsto establishaccountabilitybased on the best available evidence.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,920 strikes between August 2014 and end of July 2018. During this
period, based on information available, CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1061 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve .

In the monthofJuly, CJTF- OIRcarried over 232* openreports frompreviousmonths and receivedtwo new
reports. The assessmentof 18 civilian casualty reports has been completed. Three reports were determinedto be
credible, resultingintwo unintentionalcivilian deaths, while 15 were assessed to be non- credible. A total of216
reportsare still open.

Credible Reports-- In each of three incidents, the investigation assessed that although all feasible
precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the law of armed conflict, unintended
civilian casualties regrettably occurred.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014 , the Coalition and partner forces have
liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh , eliminating their self -proclaimed
territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh oppression . The Coalition will continue to work
with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the
resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,674 strikes between August 2014 and the end of September 2019. During this
period, based on informationavailable, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 1,346 civilians have been unintentionally
killed by Coalition actions since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigidtargeting process for all ofour strikes to ensure strict adherence to the Law ofArmed Conflict
while attemptingto avoid collateral damage. Every accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to
take all feasible precautions to avoidputting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

Inthe month of September, CJTF-OIR carried over 79 open reports from previous months and received six new
reports. CJTF - OIR completed 12 civilian - casualty allegation assessment reports. Out of the 12 completed
casualty allegation reports, six reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 11 unintentional civilian
deaths .
including two that CJTF- OIR had previously closed but reopened due to the availability of new information.

-OIR assessed the remaining six reports as non-credible . Seventy-three reports are still open ,

The results of each investigationofan allegation will fall into one of two categories, either " credible" or "non
credible." An assessment of " credible " means that our team investigatedthe allegationand determinedthat,
based on available evidence, more likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluationmeans that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our available resources, cannot
determine, to the standard of" more likely than not", that the death was the result of Coalition action. There
could be a number ofreasons for this, to includeno corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficientor overly vague data in the
allegation itself.

It is importantto note that while the Coalitionhas a substantialquantityof data at its disposalto investigate
every claim, we welcome any informationfrom any source that will enable us to determinethe truth.
Furthermore, we routinelyreopenclosed investigationsbasedon new informationthat mighthelp us attain more
accurateresults.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CombinedJoint Task Force- OperationInherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since 2014 to defeat
Daesh in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million Iraqis and Syrians from Daesh's
brutal rule.

Throughout our air and ground campaigns, we have used deliberate targeting and strike processes to
minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. Our assessments of
civilian casualties are transparent , and we hold ourselves accountable through regularly published strike
press releases and civilian casualty reports.

We are willing to work with all who bring allegations of civilian casualties to us, and we seek new or
additional information or evidence through public sources , eyewitness accounts or self-reports. We have
demonstrated willingness to re-assess past cases in the face of new or compelling evidence .

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,826 strikes between August 2014 and end of June 2018. During this
period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 1059 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve.

This month's civilian casualty total reflects the re- addition of 15 casualties from a credible report carried in
the April 2018 reports that was mistakenly left out ofthe May 2018 report.

a

In the month of June, CJTF- OIR carried over 314 open reports from previous months and received 45 new
reports. The assessment of 125 civilian casualty reports have been completed. Sixteen reports were
determined to be credible , resulting in 105 unintentional civilian deaths, while three were assessed to be
duplicate and 106 were assessed to be non-credible . A total of 234 reports are still open.

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and partner forces have
liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh, eliminating their self-proclaimed
territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work
with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the
resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition continues to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the
impact of operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This process includes thorough review and
vetting of each target package prior to a strike and another review after that strike. Regular strike reports make
Coalition activities publicly accessible, and monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes civilian
casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

As demonstrated the Coalition is willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations as well as new or
compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability based on the best available evidence .

The Coalition conducted 34,514 strikes between August 2014 and the end ofMay 2019. During this period,
based on information available, CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,319 civilians have been unintentionally killed by
Coalition strikes since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve .

In the month ofMay, CJTF -OIR carried over 111 open reports from previous months and received 77 new
reports. CJTF-OIR completed 29 civilian- casualty allegation assessment reports. Out of the 29 completed
casualty allegation reports, 13 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 17 unintentional civilian
deaths . Ofthe remaining 16 reports, and one previously unreported, 16 were assessed to be non-credible, and
one was a duplicate of a previous report. One hundred and fifty -nine reports are still open, including two that
had been previously closed but were reopened due to the availability of new information.

CredibleReports--
Coalitiontook all feasibleprecautionsandthe decisionto strike compliedwith the law ofarmed conflict.
Coalitionforces work diligentlyto be precise during the planningand executionofstrikes to reduce the risk of
harm to civilians.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since 2014 to defeat
Daesh in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million Iraqis and Syrians from Daesh's
brutal rule and reducing its control of territory to approximately one percent of what it previously held.

We continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of
our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This process includes thorough review and
vetting of each target package prior to a strike, and another review after that strike . Our regular strike
reports make our activities publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports
makes our civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to considernew civilian casualtyallegationsas well as new or
compellingevidence on past allegationsto establishaccountabilitybased on the best available evidence.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,920 strikes between August 2014 and end of July 2018. During this
period, based on information available, CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1061 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve .

In the monthofJuly, CJTF- OIRcarried over 232* openreports frompreviousmonths and receivedtwo new
reports. The assessmentof 18 civilian casualty reports has been completed. Three reports were determinedto be
credible, resultingintwo unintentionalcivilian deaths, while 15 were assessed to be non- credible. A total of216
reportsare still open.

Credible Reports-- In each of three incidents, the investigation assessed that although all feasible
precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the law of armed conflict, unintended
civilian casualties regrettably occurred.

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Sept. 26 , 2019

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014 ,
the Coalition and partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000
square kilometers (42,471 square miles ) from Daesh , eliminating
their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million
people from Daesh oppression . The Coalition will continue to
work with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and
influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the resources they
need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,573* strikes between August 2014
and the end of August 2019. During this period , based on
information available , CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,335 civilians
have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions since the
beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve .

We follow a rigid targeting process for all of our strikes to ensure
strict adherence to the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to
avoid collateral damage . Every accidental
and it will remain our goal to take all feasible precautions to avoid
putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy .

loss of life is tragic ,

In the month of August, CJTF - OIR carried over 97 open reports
from previous months and received two new reports. CJTF - OIR
completed 20 civilian -casualty allegation assessment reports.
Out of the 20 completed casualty allegation reports, seven
reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 22
unintentional civilian deaths . CJTF- OIR assessed the remaining

13 reports as non- credible. Seventy- nine reports are still open,
including two that CJTF- OIR had previously closed but reopened
due to the availability of new information.

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one
of two categories, either " credible " or "non -credible." An
assessment of " credible " means that our team investigated the
allegation and determined that, based on available evidence,
more likely than ot, the death was the result of Coalition action .
A "non -credible" evaluation means that the information we have
to assess the allegation, using our available resources, cannot
determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that the
death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number
of reasons for this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time
or that location, there was insufficient evidence to support the
allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly vague data in
the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial
quantity of data at its
welcome any information from any source that will enable us to
determine the truth. Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain
more accurate results.

to investigate every claim, we

in the seven incidents assessed as credible

Credible Reports:
in August, the investigations assessed that CJTF- OIR took all
feasible precautions, and the decision to strike complied with the
law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be
precise during the planning and execution of strikes to reduce the
risk of harm to civilians.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published May 31 , 2019

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014 ,
the Coalition and partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000
square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh , eliminating
their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million
people from Daesh oppression . The Coalition will continue to
work with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and
influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the resources they
need to resurge.

Coalition continues to employ thorough and deliberate

strike processes to minimize the impact of

targeting
operations on civilian populations and infrastructure . This process
includes thorough review and vetting of each target package prior
to a strike and another review after that strike . Regular strike
reports make Coalition activities publicly accessible , and monthly
publication of civilian casualty reports makes civilian casualty
assessments similarly accessible to the public .

As demonstrated , the Coalition is willing to consider new civilian
casualty allegations as well as new or compelling evidence on
past allegations to establish accountability based on the best
available evidence .

The Coalition conducted 34,502 strikes between August 2014 and
the end of April 2019. During this period , based on information
available , CJTF- OIR assesses at least 1,302 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the beginning of
Operation Inherent Resolve. This report includes three credible

reports that had not been previously reported in monthly CIVCAS
releases

In the month of April, CJTF- OIR carried over 122 open reports
from previous months and received seven new reports. CJTF- OIR
completed
civilian casualty allegation assessment reports. Out
of the 18 completed casualty allegation reports, three reports
were determined to be credible and resulted in five unintentional
civilian deaths. The remaining 15 reports were assessed to be
non-credible. One hundred and eleven reports are still open,
including three that had been previously closed but were
reopened due to the availability of new information.

three incidentsassessed in April and

Credible Reports--
the three previously unreported incidents, the investigations
assessed that the Coalitiontook all feasible precautions, and the
decision to strike complied with the law of armed conflict.
Coalition forces work diligently to be precise during the planning
and execution of strikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- The Coalition has worked by, with and through partners since
2014 to defeat ISIS in designated parts of Iraq and Syria, liberating nearly 8 million
Iraqis and Syrians from ISIS's brutal rule and reducing its control of territory to less
than one percent of what it had previously held.

We continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to
minimize the
of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This
process includes thorough review and vetting of each target package prior to a strike ,
and another review after that strike. Our regular strike reports make our activities
publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes our
civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations
as well as new or compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability
based on the best available evidence.
The Coalition conducted a total of 33,921 strikes between August 2014 and end of
January 2019. During this period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR
assesses at least 1257 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes
since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

a

In the month of January, CJTF-OIR carried over 182 open reports from previous
months and received 22 new reports, five of them were previously closed , but the
CIVCAS cell reopened them due to new information . The assessment of 63 civilian

casualty allegation reports has been completed. Out of the 63 completed casualty
allegation reports, 12 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 67
unintentional civilian deaths. None of the reports were determined to be duplicate
report and the remaining 51 reports were assessed to be non-credible. A total of 141
reports are still open.
Credible Reports — In each of the 12 incidents, the investigation assesses that all
feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the law of
armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be precise in our airstrikes during
the planning and execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- Since the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and
partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self-proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition willcontinue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to

We continue
minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure. This
process includes thorough review and vetting of each target package prior to a strike
and another review after that strike. Our regular strike reports make our activities
publicly accessible, and our monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes our
civilian casualty assessments similarly accessible to the public.

a

As we have demonstrated, we are willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations
as well as new or compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability
based on the best available evidence.

The Coalition conducted 34,464 strikes between August 2014 and end of March
2019. During this period, based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses at least
1291 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the beginning
of Operation Inherent Resolve.

In the month of March, CJTF- OIR carried over 146 open reportsfrom previous

months and received seven new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 31 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports; including two that had been previously closed but
were reopened with the availability of new information. Out of the 31 completed
casualty allegation reports, 11 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in
34 unintentional civilian deaths. One of the reports was determined to be a duplicate
report and the remaining 19 reports were assessed to be non-credible. One hundred
and twenty two reports are still open, including three that had been previously closed
but were reopened due to the availability of new information.

Credible Reports --In these 11 incidents , the investigation assesses that the Coalition
took all feasible precautions and the decision to strike complied with the law of armed
conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be precise during the planning and
execution of airstrikes to reduce the risk of harm to civilians .

liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh, eliminating their self-proclaimed
territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work
with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the

The Coalition continues to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the

Coalition activities publicly accessible, and monthly publication of civilian casualty reports makes civilian

As demonstrated the Coalition is willing to consider new civilian casualty allegations as well as new or
compelling evidence on past allegations to establish accountability based on the best available evidence .

The Coalition conducted 34,514 strikes between August 2014 and the end ofMay 2019. During this period,
based on information available, CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,319 civilians have been unintentionally killed by
Coalition strikes since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve .

In the month ofMay, CJTF -OIR carried over 111 open reports from previous months and received 77 new
reports. CJTF-OIR completed 29 civilian- casualty allegation assessment reports. Out of the 29 completed
casualty allegation reports, 13 reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 17 unintentional civilian
deaths . Ofthe remaining 16 reports, and one previously unreported, 16 were assessed to be non-credible, and
one was a duplicate of a previous report. One hundred and fifty -nine reports are still open, including two that
had been previously closed but were reopened due to the availability of new information.

CredibleReports--
Coalitiontook all feasibleprecautionsandthe decisionto strike compliedwith the law ofarmed conflict.
Coalitionforces work diligentlyto be precise during the planningand executionofstrikes to reduce the risk of
harm to civilians.

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Sept. 26 , 2019

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014 ,
the Coalition and partner forces have liberated nearly 110,000
square kilometers (42,471 square miles ) from Daesh , eliminating
their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million
people from Daesh oppression . The Coalition will continue to
work with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and
influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the resources they
need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,573* strikes between August 2014
and the end of August 2019. During this period , based on
information available , CJTF -OIR assesses at least 1,335 civilians
have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions since the
beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve .

We follow a rigid targeting process for all of our strikes to ensure
strict adherence to the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to
avoid collateral damage . Every accidental
and it will remain our goal to take all feasible precautions to avoid
putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy .

loss of life is tragic ,

In the month of August, CJTF - OIR carried over 97 open reports
from previous months and received two new reports. CJTF - OIR
completed 20 civilian -casualty allegation assessment reports.
Out of the 20 completed casualty allegation reports, seven
reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 22
unintentional civilian deaths . CJTF- OIR assessed the remaining

13 reports as non- credible. Seventy- nine reports are still open,
including two that CJTF- OIR had previously closed but reopened
due to the availability of new information.

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one
of two categories, either " credible " or "non -credible." An
assessment of " credible " means that our team investigated the
allegation and determined that, based on available evidence,
more likely than ot, the death was the result of Coalition action .
A "non -credible" evaluation means that the information we have
to assess the allegation, using our available resources, cannot
determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that the
death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number
of reasons for this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time
or that location, there was insufficient evidence to support the
allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly vague data in
the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial
quantity of data at its
welcome any information from any source that will enable us to
determine the truth. Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain
more accurate results.

to investigate every claim, we

in the seven incidents assessed as credible

Credible Reports:
in August, the investigations assessed that CJTF- OIR took all
feasible precautions, and the decision to strike complied with the
law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be
precise during the planning and execution of strikes to reduce the
risk of harm to civilians.

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Jan. 10, 2020

the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and

SOUTHWESTASIA
partnerforces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,725 strikes between August 2014 and the end of
November 2019. During this period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR
assesses at least 1,359 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions
since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigid targeting process for allof our strikes to ensure strict adherence to
the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to avoid collateral damage. Every
accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to take all feasible
precautions to avoid putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of November, CJTF-OIR carried over 87 open reports from previous
months and received 47 new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 52 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports. Out of the 52 completed casualty allegation reports,
four reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 12 unintentional civilian
deaths. CJTF-OIR assessed the remaining 48 reports as non-credible. 82 reports are
still open, including three that CJTF-OIR had previously closed but reopened due to
the availability of new information.

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one of two categories,
either " credible" or " non - credible ." An assessment of " credible " means that our team

investigated the allegation and determined that, based on available evidence, more
likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluation means that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our
available resources, cannot determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that
the death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number of reasons for
this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly
vague data in the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial quantity of data at its
disposal to investigate every claim , we welcome any information from any source that
will enable us to determine the truth . Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain more accurate
results .

Credible Reports: in the four incidents assessed as credible in November, the
investigations assessed that CJTF-OIR took all feasible precautions, and the decision
to strike complied with the law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA-- Since the beginning of operations in 2014 , the Coalition and partner forces have
liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles) from Daesh , eliminating their self -proclaimed
territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7 million people from Daesh oppression . The Coalition will continue to work
with partner forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny Daesh the
resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,674 strikes between August 2014 and the end of September 2019. During this
period, based on informationavailable, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 1,346 civilians have been unintentionally
killed by Coalition actions since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigidtargeting process for all ofour strikes to ensure strict adherence to the Law ofArmed Conflict
while attemptingto avoid collateral damage. Every accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to
take all feasible precautions to avoidputting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

Inthe month of September, CJTF-OIR carried over 79 open reports from previous months and received six new
reports. CJTF - OIR completed 12 civilian - casualty allegation assessment reports. Out of the 12 completed
casualty allegation reports, six reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 11 unintentional civilian
deaths .
including two that CJTF- OIR had previously closed but reopened due to the availability of new information.

-OIR assessed the remaining six reports as non-credible . Seventy-three reports are still open ,

The results of each investigationofan allegation will fall into one of two categories, either " credible" or "non
credible." An assessment of " credible " means that our team investigatedthe allegationand determinedthat,
based on available evidence, more likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluationmeans that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our available resources, cannot
determine, to the standard of" more likely than not", that the death was the result of Coalition action. There
could be a number ofreasons for this, to includeno corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficientor overly vague data in the
allegation itself.

It is importantto note that while the Coalitionhas a substantialquantityof data at its disposalto investigate
every claim, we welcome any informationfrom any source that will enable us to determinethe truth.
Furthermore, we routinelyreopenclosed investigationsbasedon new informationthat mighthelp us attain more
accurateresults.

Combined Joint Task Force Operation

Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

Published Jan. 10, 2020

the beginning of operations in 2014, the Coalition and

SOUTHWESTASIA
partnerforces have liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometers (42,471 square miles)
from Daesh, eliminating their self- proclaimed territorial caliphate and freeing 7.7
million people from Daesh oppression. The Coalition will continue to work with partner
forces to deny Daesh any physical space and influence in the region as well as deny
Daesh the resources they need to resurge.

The Coalition conducted 34,725 strikes between August 2014 and the end of
November 2019. During this period, based on information available, CJTF-OIR
assesses at least 1,359 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition actions
since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve.

We follow a rigid targeting process for allof our strikes to ensure strict adherence to
the Law of Armed Conflict while attempting to avoid collateral damage. Every
accidental loss of life is tragic, and it will remain our goal to take all feasible
precautions to avoid putting civilians in danger in our pursuit of a ruthless enemy.

In the month of November, CJTF-OIR carried over 87 open reports from previous
months and received 47 new reports. CJTF-OIR completed 52 civilian-casualty
allegation assessment reports. Out of the 52 completed casualty allegation reports,
four reports were determined to be credible and resulted in 12 unintentional civilian
deaths. CJTF-OIR assessed the remaining 48 reports as non-credible. 82 reports are
still open, including three that CJTF-OIR had previously closed but reopened due to
the availability of new information.

The results of each investigation of an allegation will fall into one of two categories,
either " credible" or " non - credible ." An assessment of " credible " means that our team

investigated the allegation and determined that, based on available evidence, more
likely than not, the death was the result of Coalition action. A "non -credible "
evaluation means that the informationwe have to assess the allegation, using our
available resources, cannot determine, to the standard of "more likely than not", that
the death was the result of Coalition action. There could be a number of reasons for
this, to include no corroborating strikes at that time or that location, there was
insufficient evidence to support the allegation, or there is simply insufficient or overly
vague data in the allegation itself.

It is important to note that while the Coalition has a substantial quantity of data at its
disposal to investigate every claim , we welcome any information from any source that
will enable us to determine the truth . Furthermore, we routinely reopen closed
investigations based on new information that might help us attain more accurate
results .

Credible Reports: in the four incidents assessed as credible in November, the
investigations assessed that CJTF-OIR took all feasible precautions, and the decision
to strike complied with the law of armed conflict. Coalition forces work diligently to be
precise during the planning and execution of strikes to reduce the risk of harm to
civilians. Numeric Key:
