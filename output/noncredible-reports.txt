FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation InherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA - The Coalition and our partners continue to conduct operations to liberate
areas from Daesh control in Syria and secure liberated areas in Iraq and Syria. Inthe past month the
Coalition and our partners executed a number of missions that killed and captured Daesh fighters.

-

Iraqi Security Forces continue to secure their people, country and borders, consolidating gains made
over the past three years, especially over the last year as many major population centers were wrested
from Daesh control . The Government of Iraq and ISF continue to secure areas and conduct clearance
operations in already liberated areas. These operations are successfully preventing Daesh fighters from
reconsolidating within Iraq.

Syrian Democratic Forces continue hard fighting against a ruthless and brutal enemy in the Middle
Euphrates River Valley, capturing and killinghundreds of Daesh terrorists in the past month.

-OIR is resolute in its mission , working with our partners to achieve a lasting defeat of Daesh and

enabling non-military stabilization activities in 2018. “ We're clear the enemy is still capable of
offensive action and retains the ability to plan and inspire attacks worldwide , ” said Brig . Gen.
Jonathan Braga, CJTF -OIR director of operations . “ We will sustain the successful momentum and
enhance our partners' capacities in pursuing Daesh and countering violent extremism, now and in the
future .”

In the month of December, CJTF- OIR carried over 603 open reports of possible civilian casualties
from previous months and received 21 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes ( artillery or air) in
support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

During this period, the Coalitioncompletedthe assessment of218 reports: 207 were assessed to be
non-credible, five were assessed to be duplicates ofprevious reports, and six were assessed to be
credible, resulting in 13 unintentional civiliandeaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF
OIR assesses at least 831 civilians have beenunintentionallykilledby Coalition strikes since the start
of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 406 reports are still open.

CombinedJoint Task Force

Operation InherentResolve

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,783 strikes between August 2014 and December 2017. During
this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,820. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 220.

a

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty report, CJTF-OIR
assessed the following 207 reports as non-credible: at this time there is insufficient information to
assess that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

A finding of non -credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. “ Non - credible ” is not intended to
deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred, nor is it intended as a comment on the
credibility on the source of the allegation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties,in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable.Twenty-sevenreports were assessed to be credible resulting in the
unintentionaldeath of 119 civilians.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the law of armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sep. 3 , 2014 near Mosul, Iraq , via Airwars report: After a review of available
information it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted in the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

Release # 20161201-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — During the month of October, CJTF-OIR received 18 reports
of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Twelve of these reports were determined to be non-credible, three
were determined to be credible, and three reports are still being assessed. Coalition
strikes are defined as strikes conducted by ground artillery or air strikes authorized as
part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all incidents
as thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to fully investigate all reports of
possible civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as
interviewing witnesses and examining the site , the Coalition interviews pilots, reviews
strike video when available, and analyzes information provided by government
agencies, non -governmental organizations, partner forces and traditional and social
media. In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order to
promote a thorough and continuous review process.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each alleged civilian
casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 12 reports received in October
are non-credible. Non-credible means that at this time there is not sufficient evidence
available to determine
, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in alleged
civilian casualties.

12. Oct. 6 , 2016, near Aleppo, Syria: No Coalition strikes were conducted on that

Although the Coalition makes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a
manner that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some cases casualties are
unavoidable. Four past reports of possible civilian casualties and three of the reports
received in October were determined to be credible resulting in the unintended death

of 54 civilians .

- MORE -

A credible assessment means that it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted
in a civilian casualty.
In each of the cases below, the investigation determined that
although all precautions were taken and the strikes complied with the Law of Armed
Conflict, civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1

March 31, 2016, near Sala Heya, Syria: During a strike on an ISIL mortar

system, it was assessed that three civilians were inadvertently killed by Coalition
counter-battery artillery near the point of origin of an ISIL mortar strike on friendly
forces.

May 16, 2016, near As Shaddadi , Syria: During a strike on seven ISIL fighters in

2 .
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that two civilians were inadvertently killed. One
civilian passenger in the vehicle was killed and one civilian riding a motorcycle was
killed when he came into proximity of the ISIL vehicle after the munition was released.

3 .
July 18, 2016 , near Manbij, Syria : During a strike that killed nearly 100 ISIL
fighters, and destroyed 13 fighting positions , seven ISIL vehicles , two VBIEDs , a
tactical vehicle, and a mortar system, it is assessed that up to 24 civilians who had
been interspersed with combatants were inadvertently killed in a known ISIL staging
area where no civilians had been seen in the 24 hours prior to the attack . Reports
indicated that approximately 100 ISIL fighters were preparing for a large counterattack
against partnered Syrian Arab Coalition/Syrian Democratic Forces and , unknown to
Coalition planners , civilians were moving around within the military staging area , even
as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days .

July 28 , 2016 , near Arghanndorh , Syria : During a strike on a moving ISIL

4 .
vehicle , 15 civilians were inadvertently killed when the munition struck the vehicle
after it slowed in a populated area after the munition was released .

5 .

Oct. 4 , 2016, nearTaltanah, Syria: During a strike targeting ISIL fighters it is

assessed that one civilian was inadvertently killed as a result of the blast following the
strike.

6 . Oct. 17, 2016 , near Idlib, Syria : During a strike on ISIL fighters it is assessed
that one civilian was inadvertently killed when he entered the target area after the
munition was released .

- MORE -

Oct. 22, 2016, near Fasitiyah, Iraq: During a strike on a building from which ISIL

7
fighters were firing on partnered Iraqi forces, eight civilians were inadvertently killed.

Currently, three reports received in October are still being assessed:

1 .

2 .

Oct. 6 , 2016 , near As Shaddadi , Syria .

Oct. 22, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

3 .

Oct. 23, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR has assessed it is more likely than
not that, since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, 173 civilians have been
inadvertently killed by Coalition strikes. We regret the unintentional loss of civilian
lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

factthat the only correlatingCoalition strikes took place at
least 30km of the alleged location, the Syria-
border;
without any additional informationconnectingthe
Coalition strikes to the allegation's location, this allegation
is assessedto be NON-CREDIBLE. Given the specificity of
the locationalleged the distance between the closest
strike and the alleged location make it more likely than not
that the strikes cited above did not lead to the CIVCAS

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sep. 3 , 2014 near Mosul, Iraq , via Airwars report: After a review of available
information it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted in the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sep. 3 , 2014 near Mosul, Iraq , via Airwars report: After a review of available

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

-

SOUTHWESTASIA - In the month of May, CJTF-OIR carried over 38 open reports of
possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 61 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 222 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 141 reports, of which 114 were assessed
to be non-credible and 27 were assessed to be credible resulting in 119 unintentional
civilian deaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it is
more likely than not, at least 603 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation InherentResolve. A total of 180 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition , the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and May 2017 , the Coalition conducted
a total of 21,910 strikes that included 46,534 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 727. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 145. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
1.56% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was

%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 114 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sep. 3 , 2014 near Mosul, Iraq , via Airwars report: After a review of available
information it was assessed that no Coalition strikes were conducted in the

Release # 20161201-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — During the month of October, CJTF-OIR received 18 reports
of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Twelve of these reports were determined to be non-credible, three
were determined to be credible, and three reports are still being assessed. Coalition
strikes are defined as strikes conducted by ground artillery or air strikes authorized as
part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all incidents
as thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to fully investigate all reports of
possible civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as
interviewing witnesses and examining the site , the Coalition interviews pilots, reviews
strike video when available, and analyzes information provided by government
agencies, non -governmental organizations, partner forces and traditional and social
media. In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order to
promote a thorough and continuous review process.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each alleged civilian
casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 12 reports received in October
are non-credible. Non-credible means that at this time there is not sufficient evidence
available to determine
, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in alleged
civilian casualties.

12. Oct. 6 , 2016, near Aleppo, Syria: No Coalition strikes were conducted on that

Although the Coalition makes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a
manner that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some cases casualties are
unavoidable. Four past reports of possible civilian casualties and three of the reports
received in October were determined to be credible resulting in the unintended death

of 54 civilians .

- MORE -

A credible assessment means that it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted
in a civilian casualty.
In each of the cases below, the investigation determined that
although all precautions were taken and the strikes complied with the Law of Armed
Conflict, civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1

March 31, 2016, near Sala Heya, Syria: During a strike on an ISIL mortar

system, it was assessed that three civilians were inadvertently killed by Coalition
counter-battery artillery near the point of origin of an ISIL mortar strike on friendly
forces.

May 16, 2016, near As Shaddadi , Syria: During a strike on seven ISIL fighters in

2 .
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that two civilians were inadvertently killed. One
civilian passenger in the vehicle was killed and one civilian riding a motorcycle was
killed when he came into proximity of the ISIL vehicle after the munition was released.

3 .
July 18, 2016 , near Manbij, Syria : During a strike that killed nearly 100 ISIL
fighters, and destroyed 13 fighting positions , seven ISIL vehicles , two VBIEDs , a
tactical vehicle, and a mortar system, it is assessed that up to 24 civilians who had
been interspersed with combatants were inadvertently killed in a known ISIL staging
area where no civilians had been seen in the 24 hours prior to the attack . Reports
indicated that approximately 100 ISIL fighters were preparing for a large counterattack
against partnered Syrian Arab Coalition/Syrian Democratic Forces and , unknown to
Coalition planners , civilians were moving around within the military staging area , even
as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days .

July 28 , 2016 , near Arghanndorh , Syria : During a strike on a moving ISIL

4 .
vehicle , 15 civilians were inadvertently killed when the munition struck the vehicle
after it slowed in a populated area after the munition was released .

5 .

Oct. 4 , 2016, nearTaltanah, Syria: During a strike targeting ISIL fighters it is

assessed that one civilian was inadvertently killed as a result of the blast following the
strike.

6 . Oct. 17, 2016 , near Idlib, Syria : During a strike on ISIL fighters it is assessed
that one civilian was inadvertently killed when he entered the target area after the
munition was released .

- MORE -

Oct. 22, 2016, near Fasitiyah, Iraq: During a strike on a building from which ISIL

7
fighters were firing on partnered Iraqi forces, eight civilians were inadvertently killed.

Currently, three reports received in October are still being assessed:

1 .

2 .

Oct. 6 , 2016 , near As Shaddadi , Syria .

Oct. 22, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

3 .

Oct. 23, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR has assessed it is more likely than
not that, since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, 173 civilians have been
inadvertently killed by Coalition strikes. We regret the unintentional loss of civilian
lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation InherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA - The Coalition and our partners continue to conduct operations to liberate
areas from Daesh control in Syria and secure liberated areas in Iraq and Syria. Inthe past month the
Coalition and our partners executed a number of missions that killed and captured Daesh fighters.

-

Iraqi Security Forces continue to secure their people, country and borders, consolidating gains made
over the past three years, especially over the last year as many major population centers were wrested
from Daesh control . The Government of Iraq and ISF continue to secure areas and conduct clearance
operations in already liberated areas. These operations are successfully preventing Daesh fighters from
reconsolidating within Iraq.

Syrian Democratic Forces continue hard fighting against a ruthless and brutal enemy in the Middle
Euphrates River Valley, capturing and killinghundreds of Daesh terrorists in the past month.

-OIR is resolute in its mission , working with our partners to achieve a lasting defeat of Daesh and

enabling non-military stabilization activities in 2018. “ We're clear the enemy is still capable of
offensive action and retains the ability to plan and inspire attacks worldwide , ” said Brig . Gen.
Jonathan Braga, CJTF -OIR director of operations . “ We will sustain the successful momentum and
enhance our partners' capacities in pursuing Daesh and countering violent extremism, now and in the
future .”

In the month of December, CJTF- OIR carried over 603 open reports of possible civilian casualties
from previous months and received 21 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes ( artillery or air) in
support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

During this period, the Coalitioncompletedthe assessment of218 reports: 207 were assessed to be
non-credible, five were assessed to be duplicates ofprevious reports, and six were assessed to be
credible, resulting in 13 unintentional civiliandeaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF
OIR assesses at least 831 civilians have beenunintentionallykilledby Coalition strikes since the start
of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 406 reports are still open.

Operation InherentResolve

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,783 strikes between August 2014 and December 2017. During
this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,820. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 220.

a

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty report, CJTF-OIR
assessed the following 207 reports as non-credible: at this time there is insufficient information to
assess that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

A finding of non -credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. “ Non - credible ” is not intended to
deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred, nor is it intended as a comment on the
credibility on the source of the allegation.

Release # 20161201-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — During the month of October, CJTF-OIR received 18 reports
of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Twelve of these reports were determined to be non-credible, three
were determined to be credible, and three reports are still being assessed. Coalition
strikes are defined as strikes conducted by ground artillery or air strikes authorized as
part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all incidents
as thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to fully investigate all reports of
possible civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as
interviewing witnesses and examining the site , the Coalition interviews pilots, reviews
strike video when available, and analyzes information provided by government
agencies, non -governmental organizations, partner forces and traditional and social
media. In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order to
promote a thorough and continuous review process.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each alleged civilian
casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 12 reports received in October
are non-credible. Non-credible means that at this time there is not sufficient evidence
available to determine
, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in alleged
civilian casualties.

12. Oct. 6 , 2016, near Aleppo, Syria: No Coalition strikes were conducted on that

Although the Coalition makes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a
manner that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some cases casualties are
unavoidable. Four past reports of possible civilian casualties and three of the reports
received in October were determined to be credible resulting in the unintended death

of 54 civilians .

- MORE -

A credible assessment means that it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted
in a civilian casualty.
In each of the cases below, the investigation determined that
although all precautions were taken and the strikes complied with the Law of Armed
Conflict, civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1

March 31, 2016, near Sala Heya, Syria: During a strike on an ISIL mortar

system, it was assessed that three civilians were inadvertently killed by Coalition
counter-battery artillery near the point of origin of an ISIL mortar strike on friendly
forces.

May 16, 2016, near As Shaddadi , Syria: During a strike on seven ISIL fighters in

2 .
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that two civilians were inadvertently killed. One
civilian passenger in the vehicle was killed and one civilian riding a motorcycle was
killed when he came into proximity of the ISIL vehicle after the munition was released.

3 .
July 18, 2016 , near Manbij, Syria : During a strike that killed nearly 100 ISIL
fighters, and destroyed 13 fighting positions , seven ISIL vehicles , two VBIEDs , a
tactical vehicle, and a mortar system, it is assessed that up to 24 civilians who had
been interspersed with combatants were inadvertently killed in a known ISIL staging
area where no civilians had been seen in the 24 hours prior to the attack . Reports
indicated that approximately 100 ISIL fighters were preparing for a large counterattack
against partnered Syrian Arab Coalition/Syrian Democratic Forces and , unknown to
Coalition planners , civilians were moving around within the military staging area , even
as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days .

July 28 , 2016 , near Arghanndorh , Syria : During a strike on a moving ISIL

4 .
vehicle , 15 civilians were inadvertently killed when the munition struck the vehicle
after it slowed in a populated area after the munition was released .

5 .

Oct. 4 , 2016, nearTaltanah, Syria: During a strike targeting ISIL fighters it is

assessed that one civilian was inadvertently killed as a result of the blast following the
strike.

6 . Oct. 17, 2016 , near Idlib, Syria : During a strike on ISIL fighters it is assessed
that one civilian was inadvertently killed when he entered the target area after the
munition was released .

- MORE -

Oct. 22, 2016, near Fasitiyah, Iraq: During a strike on a building from which ISIL

7
fighters were firing on partnered Iraqi forces, eight civilians were inadvertently killed.

Currently, three reports received in October are still being assessed:

1 .

2 .

Oct. 6 , 2016 , near As Shaddadi , Syria .

Oct. 22, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

3 .

Oct. 23, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR has assessed it is more likely than
not that, since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, 173 civilians have been
inadvertently killed by Coalition strikes. We regret the unintentional loss of civilian
lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

Based on a thorough assessment of all reasonably

indicates that there were no civilian injuries or deaths resulting from the strike . This
assessment is based on four major factors.

( 1 ( SHREL TO USA,

) The munition did not directly impact the civilian

vehicle . Instead, it struck between the target vehicle and the civilian vehicle in question .
This is not to say that the occupants could not have been injured or killed by the strike .

Release # 20170602-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — In the month of April , CJTF-OIR received 43 new reports of
possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in support of partnered
force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria . During this period , the Coalition
completed the assessment of 47 reports, of which 31 were assessed to be non
credible and 16 were assessed to be credible resulting in 132 unintentional civilian
deaths . To date , based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses that , it is more
likely than not , at least 484 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve . A total of 38 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month . Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

government agencies, non-governmental

To date, based on data between August 2014 and April2017, the Coalition conducted

a total of 21,035 strikes that included 44,330 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 440. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 118. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
.99%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was .27%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 31 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sept. 17, 2016, near Al Tabqah, Syria , via self-report: After a review of available

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Sixteen reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the
unintentional death of 132 civilians.
A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although allfeasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.
1. Jan. 31, 2017, near Dayr Az Zayr, Syria, via self-report: During a strike on ISIS

Release # 20161201-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — During the month of October, CJTF-OIR received 18 reports
of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Twelve of these reports were determined to be non-credible, three
were determined to be credible, and three reports are still being assessed. Coalition
strikes are defined as strikes conducted by ground artillery or air strikes authorized as
part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all incidents
as thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to fully investigate all reports of
possible civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as
interviewing witnesses and examining the site , the Coalition interviews pilots, reviews
strike video when available, and analyzes information provided by government
agencies, non -governmental organizations, partner forces and traditional and social
media. In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order to
promote a thorough and continuous review process.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each alleged civilian
casualty report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 12 reports received in October
are non-credible. Non-credible means that at this time there is not sufficient evidence
available to determine
, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in alleged
civilian casualties.

unavoidable. Four past reports of possible civilian casualties and three of the reports
received in October were determined to be credible resulting in the unintended death

of 54 civilians .

A credible assessment means that it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted
in a civilian casualty.
In each of the cases below, the investigation determined that
although all precautions were taken and the strikes complied with the Law of Armed
Conflict, civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1

March 31, 2016, near Sala Heya, Syria: During a strike on an ISIL mortar

system, it was assessed that three civilians were inadvertently killed by Coalition
counter-battery artillery near the point of origin of an ISIL mortar strike on friendly
forces.

May 16, 2016, near As Shaddadi , Syria: During a strike on seven ISIL fighters in

2 .
a moving vehicle, it was assessed that two civilians were inadvertently killed. One
civilian passenger in the vehicle was killed and one civilian riding a motorcycle was
killed when he came into proximity of the ISIL vehicle after the munition was released.

3 .
July 18, 2016 , near Manbij, Syria : During a strike that killed nearly 100 ISIL
fighters, and destroyed 13 fighting positions , seven ISIL vehicles , two VBIEDs , a
tactical vehicle, and a mortar system, it is assessed that up to 24 civilians who had
been interspersed with combatants were inadvertently killed in a known ISIL staging
area where no civilians had been seen in the 24 hours prior to the attack . Reports
indicated that approximately 100 ISIL fighters were preparing for a large counterattack
against partnered Syrian Arab Coalition/Syrian Democratic Forces and , unknown to
Coalition planners , civilians were moving around within the military staging area , even
as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days .

July 28 , 2016 , near Arghanndorh , Syria : During a strike on a moving ISIL

after it slowed in a populated area after the munition was released .

5 .

Oct. 4 , 2016, nearTaltanah, Syria: During a strike targeting ISIL fighters it is

assessed that one civilian was inadvertently killed as a result of the blast following the
strike.

6 . Oct. 17, 2016 , near Idlib, Syria : During a strike on ISIL fighters it is assessed
that one civilian was inadvertently killed when he entered the target area after the
munition was released .

- MORE -

Oct. 22, 2016, near Fasitiyah, Iraq: During a strike on a building from which ISIL

7
fighters were firing on partnered Iraqi forces, eight civilians were inadvertently killed.

Currently, three reports received in October are still being assessed:

Oct. 22, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

3 .

Oct. 23, 2016, near Qaraqosh and Hasana , Iraq.

To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR has assessed it is more likely than
not that, since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, 173 civilians have been
inadvertently killed by Coalition strikes. We regret the unintentional loss of civilian
lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA - In the month of June, CJTF-OIR carried over 180 open reports
of possible civilian casualties from previous months and received 72 new reports
resultingfrom Coalition strikes in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria. Additionally, the Coalition began the assessments of 304 historical
reports of possible civilian casualties received from Airwars.org. During this period,
the Coalition completed the assessment of 132 reports, of which 121 were assessed
to be non-credible and seven were assessed to be credible, resulting in 21
unintentional civilian deaths. Four reports were assessed to be a duplicates of
previous reports. To date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses that, it
is more likely than not, at least 624 civilians have been unintentionally killed by
Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 424 reports
were still open and being assessed at the end of the month. Coalition strikes are
defined as ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking
Order

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as

civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available,
and analyzes information provided by government agencies, non-governmental
reports, partnerforces, and traditional and social media. In addition, the Coalition

considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a thorough
and continuous review process .

To date, based on data between August 2014 and June 2017, the Coalition
conducted a total of 22,983 strikes that included 48,636 separate engagements.
During this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1101.
The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was
151. The percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian
casualties was 2.26%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report
of civilian casualties was .31%

a

report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 121 reports are non-credible . Non

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Seven reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the
unintentional death of 21 civilians.
A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the law of armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA- During the month of December 2016 , CJTF-OIR received 12 new reports and
assessed 11 reports of possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
fight to defeat ISIL. Coalition strikes are defined as ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the
Coalition Air Tasking Order.

-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses reports as thoroughly as possible.

Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible civilian casualties using traditional
investigative methods, such as by interviewing witnesses and examining the site, we do interview pilots
and other personnel involved in targeting decisions, review aircraft video if available , and analyze
information provided by government agencies, non - governmental organizations, partner forces and
traditional and social media In addition, we consider new information when it becomes available in order
to promote a thorough and continuous review process .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each report, CJTF- OIR assessed that the
following seven reports are non-credible at this time. An assessment that a report is non-credible means
that there is not sufficient evidence available to determine whether, more likely than not, a Coalition strike
resulted in the reported civilian casualties .

1. Feb. 15, 2016, Hama Province, Syria, via social media report: Date correction. This report was

previously incorrectly released as Feb. 2, 2016 in the Jan. 2, 2016 monthly report. No Coalition strikes
were conducted on that day in the geographic area of the reported civilian casualties.

2. July 20 , 2016, near Manbij, Syria, via social media report: This report of civilian casualties was assessed

to be a duplicate of a previous report released as July 18, 2016, near Manbij, Syria, in the Dec. 1, 2016,
monthly report

3. Oct. 6, 2016, near Al Shadadi Syria, via self -report: After a review of available information and strike

a

video it was assessed that no civilians were harmed in this strike.

8. Dec. 29 2016, near Mosul Iraq, via self - report: After a review of available information and strike video

a

it was assessed that no civilians were harmed in this

.

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner that minimizes the
risk to civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are unavoidable. Four reports were assessed to be
credible resulting in the unintended death of 11 civilians. A credible assessment means that, it is more
likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted ina civilian casualty. Ineach of the reports below, it was
assessed that even though feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with the Law
of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

1. Oct. 25 , 2016, near Mosul Iraq, via self -report: During a strike on ISIL fighters in a moving vehicle it is

assessed that one civilian was unintentionallykilledwhen the target vehicle passedhis locationat the
time of the munition'simpact.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA

During the month of February 2017 , CJTF-OIR carried over 19 open reports of possible
civilian casualties from previous months, received 41 new reports, and completed the assessment on 17 reports
to defeat ISIS . Twelve of these reports were assessed to
resulting from Coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria in the
be non -credible and five were assessed to be credible . A total of 43 reports are still open and being assessed at the
of the month . Coalition strikes are defined as ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air

Tasking Order

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as thoroughly as possible .
Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible civilian casualties using traditional
investigative
methods, such as by interviewing witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other
personnel involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillance video if available, and analyzes
information provided by government agencies, non-governmental organizations , partner forces and traditional and
social media. In addition, the Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to promote a
thorough and continuous review process.

To date, based on data between August 2014 and February 2017 , the Coalition conducted a total of 18,645 strikes
that included 42,089 separate engagements . During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian
casualties was 396. The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this period was 102. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties
was .94 % . The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian casualties was

% .

In Mosul, Iraq, sincethe start of operationsto liberatethe city on Oct. 17, 2016, to the liberationof the East side of
Mosul on Feb. 18, 2017, the total numberof reports of possiblecivilian casualtieswas 37. The total numberof
credible reports during this time period was 15. The percent of engagementsin Mosul during this time period that
resultedin a credible reportof credible civilian casualtieswas .37% .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstancesof each civilian casualty report, CJTF- OIR assessedthat the
following 12 reports are non- credible. Non- credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information
availableto assess that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resultedin civilian casualties.

1. Jan. 2, 2017 , near Mosul , Iraq, via social media report: No Coalition strikes were conducted on that day in the
geographic area of the reported civilian casualties .

been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. We regret the
unintentional loss of civilian lives resulting from Coalition efforts to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and express our
deepest sympathies to the families and others affected by these strikes .

Release # 20170602-02
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA — In the month of April , CJTF-OIR received 43 new reports of
possible civilian casualties resulting from Coalition strikes in support of partnered
force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria . During this period , the Coalition
completed the assessment of 47 reports, of which 31 were assessed to be non
credible and 16 were assessed to be credible resulting in 132 unintentional civilian
deaths . To date , based on information available , CJTF-OIR assesses that , it is more
likely than not , at least 484 civilians have been unintentionally killed by Coalition
strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve . A total of 38 reports were still
open and being assessed at the end of the month . Coalition strikes are defined as
ground artillery or air strikes conducted as part of the Coalition Air Tasking Order.

CJTF-OIR takes all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assesses all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Although we are unable to investigate all reports of possible
civilian casualties using traditional investigative methods, such as interviewing
witnesses and examining the site, the Coalition interviews pilots and other personnel
involved in the targeting process, reviews strike and surveillancevideo if available,
and analyzes information provided
organizations, partner forces, and traditional and social media. In addition, the
Coalition considers new information when it becomes available in order to ensure a
thorough and continuous review process.

government agencies, non-governmental

To date, based on data between August 2014 and April2017, the Coalition conducted

a total of 21,035 strikes that included 44,330 separate engagements . During this
period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 440. The total
number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 118. The
percent of engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was
.99%. The percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian
casualties was .27%.

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF-OIR assessed that the following 31 reports are non-credible. Non
credible means that at this time there is not sufficient information available to assess
that, more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

1. Sept. 17, 2016, near Al Tabqah, Syria , via self-report: After a review of available
information and strike video it was assessed that no civilians were harmed in this
strike.

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Sixteen reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the
unintentional death of 132 civilians.
A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although allfeasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the Law of Armed Conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

CJTF -OIR Monthly Civilian Casualty

By CJTF-OIR PAO / Published Nov. 30, 2017
SOUTHWEST ASIA – The Coalition is constantly improving its visibility on and
accountability for allegations. From October through early November, the Coalition Civilian
Casualty Assessment Team traveled throughout the region and reviewed procedures and
processes to increase efficiency of assessments. The team also trained approximately 30
members of Coalition components inthe assessment process to ensure allegations of civilian
casualties are addressed as quickly as possible. We continue to hold ourselves accountable for
actions that may have caused unintentional injury or death to civilians.

take extraordinary care to protect the

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the site
where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video, and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non -governmentalreports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process. At times, we have re-opened investigations in light of new evidence .

Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraqfrom ISIS control began in
2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 96% of ISIS-held land to local populations
and governance , liberating approximately 7.5 million Syrians and Iraqis .

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists, to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct combat
with the terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its brutal
three- year occupation.

a

The Coalition is extremely concerned about explosive remnants of war that still pose a threat
to returning civilians in areas cleared of Daesh . The United States has invested $333 million
toward the clearance and safe disposal of landmines , unexploded ordnance (UXO), and

securing excess conventional weapons and munitions in Iraq since 2003. This includes the
removal ofnearly 40,000 kilograms of explosives since April2016 from liberated areas in
Iraq, according to the State Department'sOffice of Weapons Removal and Abatement.

The Coalition also remains committed to training partner forces in
bomb disposal units that efficiently disarm dangerous traps left by ISIS in order to provide a
safe and secure environment for their people. The Coalition and our partners have taken
significant steps to protect innocent lives, and we will continue to do so .

capabilities such as

In the month of October, CJTF-OIR carried over 519 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 240 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
(artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria .

During this period, the Coalition completed the assessment of 64 reports: 55 were assessed to
be non-credible , four were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and five were
assessed to be credible , resulting in 15 unintentional civilian deaths . To date, based on
information available , CJTF-OIR assesses at least 801 civilians have been unintentionally
killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 695 reports
are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,198 strikes that included 56,976 separate engagements
between August 2014 and October
possible civilian casualties was 1,790. The total number of credible reports of civilian
casualties during this time period was 199. The percent of engagements that resulted in a
report of possible civilian casualties was 3.14% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a
crediblereport of civilian casualties was .35% .

Duringthis period, the total number of reports of

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civiliancasualty report, CJTF
OIR assessed the following 55 reports as non -credible: at this time there is insufficient
information to assess that, more likely than not,a Coalition strike resulted in civilian
casualties.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation InherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA - The Coalition and our partners continue to conduct operations to liberate
areas from Daesh control in Syria and secure liberated areas in Iraq and Syria. Inthe past month the
Coalition and our partners executed a number of missions that killed and captured Daesh fighters.

-

Iraqi Security Forces continue to secure their people, country and borders, consolidating gains made
over the past three years, especially over the last year as many major population centers were wrested
from Daesh control . The Government of Iraq and ISF continue to secure areas and conduct clearance
operations in already liberated areas. These operations are successfully preventing Daesh fighters from
reconsolidating within Iraq.

Syrian Democratic Forces continue hard fighting against a ruthless and brutal enemy in the Middle
Euphrates River Valley, capturing and killinghundreds of Daesh terrorists in the past month.

-OIR is resolute in its mission , working with our partners to achieve a lasting defeat of Daesh and

enabling non-military stabilization activities in 2018. “ We're clear the enemy is still capable of
offensive action and retains the ability to plan and inspire attacks worldwide , ” said Brig . Gen.
Jonathan Braga, CJTF -OIR director of operations . “ We will sustain the successful momentum and
enhance our partners' capacities in pursuing Daesh and countering violent extremism, now and in the
future .”

In the month of December, CJTF- OIR carried over 603 open reports of possible civilian casualties
from previous months and received 21 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes ( artillery or air) in
support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

During this period, the Coalitioncompletedthe assessment of218 reports: 207 were assessed to be
non-credible, five were assessed to be duplicates ofprevious reports, and six were assessed to be
credible, resulting in 13 unintentional civiliandeaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF
OIR assesses at least 831 civilians have beenunintentionallykilledby Coalition strikes since the start
of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 406 reports are still open.

Operation InherentResolve

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,783 strikes between August 2014 and December 2017. During
this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,820. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 220.

a

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty report, CJTF-OIR
assessed the following 207 reports as non-credible: at this time there is insufficient information to
assess that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

A finding of non -credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. “ Non - credible ” is not intended to
deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred, nor is it intended as a comment on the
credibility on the source of the allegation.

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT : CIVCAS Allegation Closure Report Allegation No. 1142

1. (U) BLUF. Based on the below findings, this allegation is NOT CREDIBLE. A
search of all available strike recordsfound no corroboratingstrikes; therefore, there is
insufficientevidence to corroborate the allegation. CJTF-OIR CIVCAS Cell shall close
this allegation and make available for immediate public release.

2. (U) Background.

I consideredthe following informationin makingmy findings:

a . (U ) On 12 June2017, an IGO representativereportedthe following: On 1 June, a

male civilian was allegedly killed by a landmine north of Ar-Raqqa city.

b . (

12 August 2017, CJTF- OIR CIVCAS Cell approved the
Assessment ( IA) and determined the allegation should be closed at the IA.

3.

(U) CJTF Initial Assessment

Airwars.org did not contain a corroborating allegation.

a . (

b . (

The allegationdid not include picture or video evidence of CIVCAS.

Moreover, the allegationdid not provide a specific location, e.g., MGRS, name of
building

(SHREL

Based on the lack of detail in the allegations to narrow the search ,
it would be unreasonable to make assessment of credibility . Additionally, the allegation
cites that the civilian was killed by a landmine, which is a weapon more typically
associated with ISIS (IEDs, for example rather than the munitions used by the
Coalition.

d . ( SHREL

Accordingly, CJTF-OIR CIVCAS Cell recommended closing this

allegation at the Initial Assessment due to insufficient evidence to corroborate the
allegation

4. (U) Action

(U) I direct closure of this CIVCAS incident and that CJTF-OIR PAO publish the result of
this CIVCAS assessment in a press release as soon as practicable .

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraq from
ISIS control began in 2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 83 % of ISIS-held
land to local populations and governance . The effort has liberated more than six million
Syrians and Iraqis.

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists , to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct
combat with a terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its
brutal three-year occupation.

a

Iraqi Security Forces, including more than 115,000 trained by Coalition partners, continue to
clear the last remaining pockets of ISIS in Hawija and western Anbar Province. The October
2016 to July 2017 battle to liberate Mosul reflects a significant sacrifice by our Iraqi partners,
who lost 1,200-1,500 personnel in action, with an approximate 8,000 more wounded.

The Syrian Democratic Forces , who continue to defeat ISIS in Dayr Az Zawr Province and
Raqqah, have suffered similarly in efforts to rid their nation of ISIS, with approximately 1100
troops killed and 3900 more wounded in the ongoing fight.

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and Syria take extraordinary care to protect the
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports
as thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the
site where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video , and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non-governmental reports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process.

In the month of August , CJTF-OIR carried over 455 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 80 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
( artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

liberated 7.7 million Iraqis and Syrians once held under brutal Daesh rule. However,
much work still needs to be done to ensure the lasting defeat of the terrorist, criminal
organization

of the area formerly controlled by Daesh, and have

In January the Iraqi Security Forces demonstrated proficiency and professionalism in
providing security for Iraqi Army Day and Iraqi Police Day without incident. Iraqi
forces continue to take the fight to Daesh terrorists hiding among the people of Iraq.
The ISF conducted multiple operations to secure their country, people and borders.
The security they provide enables the international community to support non-military
stabilization operations and assist in the return to normal life for the Iraqi people who
have hope for a better life after Daesh.

Syrian Democratic Forces and Coalition partners continued operations to destroy
remnants of Daesh in Syria. SDF's successes and continued efforts to remove
terrorists from the battlefield and deny Daesh safe haven have been a benefit to the
world, preventing the regional and global spread of a hateful ideology that actively
seeks to

our homes and our populations. This was demonstrated when a

significant precision strike, involving exhaustive intelligence and observation to
confirm Daesh concentrations and ensure no civilian casualties, killed between 145
150 Daesh terrorists in the Middle Euphrates River Valley Jan. 20.

The SDF's presence in Syria continues to reap dividends as they detain terrorists
trying to escape the region. Early in January, the SDF were instrumental
two of Daesh's most violent terrorists from the battlefield as they tried to flee .

In the month of January, CJTF-OIR carried over 406 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 195 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat Daesh
in Iraq and Syria .

During this period , the Coalition completed the assessment of 116 reports: 102 were
assessed to be

non-credible, 10 were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and four were
assessed to be credible, resulting in 10 unintentional civilian deaths. To date, based
on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 841 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent
Resolve. A total of 485 reports are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,070 strikes between August 2014 and January
2018. During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties
was 2,015 . The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time
period was 218 .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 102 reports as non- credible : at this time
there is insufficient information to assess that , more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

A finding of non-credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. "Non-credible " is
not intended to deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred , nor is it intended
as a comment on the credibility on the source of the allegation .

search of all available strike recordsfound no corroboratingstrikes; therefore, there is
insufficient evidence to corroborate the allegation. CJTF-OIR CIVCAS Cellshall close
this allegation and make available for immediate public release.

2.

(U ) Background.

I considered the following information in making my findings:

a . (U) On 2 August2017, WebOps

- Syria reported: SM TW userscirculated ISIS
news agency Amaq reportthat claimedCFs airstrikeon AL -Mazravillage nearTal Afar
has killed 5 civilians and injured 3 others.

b .

On 11August2017, CJTF- OIR CIVCAS Cell approvedthe
Assessment(IA) and determinedthe allegation should be closed at the IA.

3.

( U CJTF Initial Assessment

Airwars.orgdid not contain a corroboratingallegation.

a . (

b . (

The allegationdid not include picture or video evidence of CIVCAS.

Moreover, the allegationdid not provide a specific location, e.g., MGRS, name of

C. (

Based on the poor quality of the single, ISIS propaganda media source,

it would be unreasonable to make assessment of credibility .

d . (

Accordingly, CJTF-OIR CIVCAS Cell recommended closing this

allegation at the Initial Assessment due to insufficient evidence to corroborate the
allegation

4.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian

Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraq from
ISIS control began in 2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 83 % of ISIS-held
land to local populations and governance . The effort has liberated more than six million
Syrians and Iraqis.

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists , to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct
combat with a terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its
brutal three-year occupation.

a

Iraqi Security Forces, including more than 115,000 trained by Coalition partners, continue to
clear the last remaining pockets of ISIS in Hawija and western Anbar Province. The October
2016 to July 2017 battle to liberate Mosul reflects a significant sacrifice by our Iraqi partners,
who lost 1,200-1,500 personnel in action, with an approximate 8,000 more wounded.

The Syrian Democratic Forces , who continue to defeat ISIS in Dayr Az Zawr Province and
Raqqah, have suffered similarly in efforts to rid their nation of ISIS, with approximately 1100
troops killed and 3900 more wounded in the ongoing fight.

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and Syria take extraordinary care to protect the
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports
as thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the
site where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video , and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non-governmental reports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process.

In the month of August , CJTF-OIR carried over 455 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 80 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
( artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOUTHWEST ASIA Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraq
from ISIS control began in 2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 95% of
ISIS-held land to local populations and governance. The effort has liberated 6.9
million Syrians and Iraqis.

Despite significant successesagainst ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations
suffering under the militant extremists, to includethe brave Iraqis and Syrians
engaged in direct combat with a terrorist organization that has killed countless
innocent civilians during its brutal three-year occupation.

a

Security Forces, including nearly 120,000 trained by Coalition partners, continue
to back-clear previously liberated areas and prepare for major operations in western
Anbar and the middle Euphrates River valley. The October 2016 to July 2017 battle to
liberate Mosul reflects a significant sacrifice by our Iraqi partners, who lost 1,200
1,500 personnel in action, with an approximate 8,000 more wounded .

The Syrian Democratic Forces, including more than 12,200 trained by Coalition
partners, have liberated the city of Raqqah and continue to defeat ISIS in its last
remaining pockets in Syria, have suffered similarly in efforts to rid their nation of ISIS,
with approximately 1,100 troops killed and 3,900 more wounded in the ongoing fight.

The Coalition and our partnerforces in Iraq and Syria take extraordinary care to
protect the civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and

assess all reports as thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing
witnesses and examining the site where possible, interviewing pilots and other
personnel involved in the targeting process, reviewing strike and surveillance video ,
and analyzing information provided by government agencies, non -governmental
reports, partner forces, and traditional and social media . We consider new information
when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous review process.

In the month of September, CJTF -OIR carried more than 344 open reports of possible
civilian casualties from previous months and received 302 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in
Iraq and Syria .
-MORE

During this period , the Coalition completed the assessment of 127 reports: 105 were
assessed to be non-credible, six were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports,
and 16 were assessed to be credible, resulting in 51 unintentional civilian deaths. To
date, based on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 786 civilians have
been unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent
Resolve. A total of 519 reports are still open and being assessed at the end of the
month

The Coalition conducted a total of 27,566 strikes that included 56,099 separate
engagements between September 2014 and September 2017. During this period , the
total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,266. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 194. The percent of
engagements that resulted in a report of possible civilian casualties was 2.26% . The
percent of engagements that resulted in a credible report of civilian casualties was
.35%

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 105 reports as non- credible : at this time
there is insufficient information to assess that, more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

CJTF -OIR Monthly Civilian Casualty

By CJTF-OIR PAO / Published Nov. 30, 2017
SOUTHWEST ASIA – The Coalition is constantly improving its visibility on and
accountability for allegations. From October through early November, the Coalition Civilian
Casualty Assessment Team traveled throughout the region and reviewed procedures and
processes to increase efficiency of assessments. The team also trained approximately 30
members of Coalition components inthe assessment process to ensure allegations of civilian
casualties are addressed as quickly as possible. We continue to hold ourselves accountable for
actions that may have caused unintentional injury or death to civilians.

take extraordinary care to protect the

The Coalition and our partner forces in Iraq and
civilian population. We take all reports of civilian casualties seriously and assess all reports as
thoroughly as possible. Investigations include interviewing witnesses and examining the site
where possible, interviewing pilots and other personnel involved in the targeting process,
reviewing strike and surveillance video, and analyzing information provided by government
agencies, non -governmentalreports, partner forces, and traditional and social media. We
consider new information when it becomes available to ensure a thorough and continuous
review process. At times, we have re-opened investigations in light of new evidence .

Since Coalition operations to free the people of Syria and Iraqfrom ISIS control began in
2014 , Coalition partners have returned more than 96% of ISIS-held land to local populations
and governance , liberating approximately 7.5 million Syrians and Iraqis .

Despite significant successes against ISIS, combat has taken a toll on populations suffering
under the militant extremists, to include the brave Iraqis and Syrians engaged in direct combat
with the terrorist organization that has killed countless innocent civilians during its brutal
three- year occupation.

a

The Coalition is extremely concerned about explosive remnants of war that still pose a threat
to returning civilians in areas cleared of Daesh . The United States has invested $333 million
toward the clearance and safe disposal of landmines , unexploded ordnance (UXO), and

securing excess conventional weapons and munitions in Iraq since 2003. This includes the
removal ofnearly 40,000 kilograms of explosives since April2016 from liberated areas in
Iraq, according to the State Department'sOffice of Weapons Removal and Abatement.

The Coalition also remains committed to training partner forces in
bomb disposal units that efficiently disarm dangerous traps left by ISIS in order to provide a
safe and secure environment for their people. The Coalition and our partners have taken
significant steps to protect innocent lives, and we will continue to do so .

capabilities such as

In the month of October, CJTF-OIR carried over 519 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 240 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes
(artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria .

During this period, the Coalition completed the assessment of 64 reports: 55 were assessed to
be non-credible , four were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and five were
assessed to be credible , resulting in 15 unintentional civilian deaths . To date, based on
information available , CJTF-OIR assesses at least 801 civilians have been unintentionally
killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 695 reports
are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,198 strikes that included 56,976 separate engagements
between August 2014 and October
possible civilian casualties was 1,790. The total number of credible reports of civilian
casualties during this time period was 199. The percent of engagements that resulted in a
report of possible civilian casualties was 3.14% . The percent of engagements that resulted in a
crediblereport of civilian casualties was .35% .

Duringthis period, the total number of reports of

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civiliancasualty report, CJTF
OIR assessed the following 55 reports as non -credible: at this time there is insufficient
information to assess that, more likely than not,a Coalition strike resulted in civilian

( U ) WebOps Russian SPOT Report 12 NOV 1435Z 2017 : Pro- Kremlin Media Outlets
Claim that US-led Coalition airstrike killed 10 Civilians in Deir ez-Zor, Syria.
( U ) At approximately 1000Z on 12 NOV 2017, citing Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA),
Russian media outlets reported that US-led Coalition warplanes attacked the village of
Duaiji

in the province of Deir ez-Zor on the Syrian-Iraqi border and stated that the alleged
airstrike
killed 10 civilians. Citing SANA the article states that the aviation targeted residential
sites in
Tal al-Shayer where one of the airstrikes hit an ambulance and killed everyone in the
vehicle.
Seperately, the article states that last Thursday on 09 NOV , the Syrian Permanent
Mission to
the United Nations sent a letter to the Secretary General of the UN and to the chairman
of the

Security Council accusing the US-led Coalition covering up the withdrawal of ISIS
fighters
from Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor during operations to liberate mentioned cities . Separately,
the
article mentions the Syrian Army's success in liberating the last stronghold of ISIS in
the
Syrian city of Abu-Kamal and the final stages of the fight against terrorists in Iraq
where the
military liberated Rumana district and moving towards Rawa city which is about 100
kilometers from Abu- Kamal. Separately, the article reports stated that the US- led
Coalition

actions are not coordinated with the official Syrian Government and the UN Security
Council
and as a reminder that at the end of October the US-led Coalition admitted killing 786
civilians as a result of airstrikes conducted in Syria and Iraq from the beginning of the
military
operation against terrorists in August 2014.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation InherentResolve

Monthly Civilian Casualty Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA - The Coalition and our partners continue to conduct operations to liberate
areas from Daesh control in Syria and secure liberated areas in Iraq and Syria. Inthe past month the
Coalition and our partners executed a number of missions that killed and captured Daesh fighters.

-

Iraqi Security Forces continue to secure their people, country and borders, consolidating gains made
over the past three years, especially over the last year as many major population centers were wrested
from Daesh control . The Government of Iraq and ISF continue to secure areas and conduct clearance
operations in already liberated areas. These operations are successfully preventing Daesh fighters from
reconsolidating within Iraq.

Syrian Democratic Forces continue hard fighting against a ruthless and brutal enemy in the Middle
Euphrates River Valley, capturing and killinghundreds of Daesh terrorists in the past month.

-OIR is resolute in its mission , working with our partners to achieve a lasting defeat of Daesh and

enabling non-military stabilization activities in 2018. “ We're clear the enemy is still capable of
offensive action and retains the ability to plan and inspire attacks worldwide , ” said Brig . Gen.
Jonathan Braga, CJTF -OIR director of operations . “ We will sustain the successful momentum and
enhance our partners' capacities in pursuing Daesh and countering violent extremism, now and in the
future .”

In the month of December, CJTF- OIR carried over 603 open reports of possible civilian casualties
from previous months and received 21 new reports resulting from Coalition strikes ( artillery or air) in
support of partner force operations to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

During this period, the Coalitioncompletedthe assessment of218 reports: 207 were assessed to be
non-credible, five were assessed to be duplicates ofprevious reports, and six were assessed to be
credible, resulting in 13 unintentional civiliandeaths. To date, based on information available, CJTF
OIR assesses at least 831 civilians have beenunintentionallykilledby Coalition strikes since the start
of Operation Inherent Resolve. A total of 406 reports are still open.

CombinedJoint Task Force

Operation InherentResolve

The Coalition conducted a total of 28,783 strikes between August 2014 and December 2017. During
this period, the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties was 1,820. The total number of
credible reports of civilian casualties during this time period was 220.

a

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty report, CJTF-OIR
assessed the following 207 reports as non-credible: at this time there is insufficient information to
assess that , more likely than not, a Coalition strike resulted in civilian casualties.

A finding of non -credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. “ Non - credible ” is not intended to
deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred, nor is it intended as a comment on the
credibility on the source of the allegation.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian Casualty
Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- During the month of January the Coalition and our partners
continued the fight to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh. The Coalition and our
partners have liberated over 98
liberated 7.7 million Iraqis and Syrians once held under brutal Daesh rule. However,
much work still needs to be done to ensure the lasting defeat of the terrorist, criminal
organization

of the area formerly controlled by Daesh, and have

In January the Iraqi Security Forces demonstrated proficiency and professionalism in
providing security for Iraqi Army Day and Iraqi Police Day without incident. Iraqi
forces continue to take the fight to Daesh terrorists hiding among the people of Iraq.
The ISF conducted multiple operations to secure their country, people and borders.
The security they provide enables the international community to support non-military
stabilization operations and assist in the return to normal life for the Iraqi people who
have hope for a better life after Daesh.

Syrian Democratic Forces and Coalition partners continued operations to destroy
remnants of Daesh in Syria. SDF's successes and continued efforts to remove
terrorists from the battlefield and deny Daesh safe haven have been a benefit to the
world, preventing the regional and global spread of a hateful ideology that actively
seeks to

our homes and our populations. This was demonstrated when a

significant precision strike, involving exhaustive intelligence and observation to
confirm Daesh concentrations and ensure no civilian casualties, killed between 145
150 Daesh terrorists in the Middle Euphrates River Valley Jan. 20.

The SDF's presence in Syria continues to reap dividends as they detain terrorists
trying to escape the region. Early in January, the SDF were instrumental
two of Daesh's most violent terrorists from the battlefield as they tried to flee .

in removing

In the month of January, CJTF-OIR carried over 406 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 195 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat Daesh
in Iraq and Syria .

During this period , the Coalition completed the assessment of 116 reports: 102 were
assessed to be

non-credible, 10 were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and four were
assessed to be credible, resulting in 10 unintentional civilian deaths. To date, based
on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 841 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent
Resolve. A total of 485 reports are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,070 strikes between August 2014 and January
2018. During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties
was 2,015 . The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time
period was 218 .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 102 reports as non- credible : at this time
there is insufficient information to assess that , more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

A finding of non-credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. "Non-credible " is
not intended to deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred , nor is it intended
as a comment on the credibility on the source of the allegation .

Although the Coalition takes extraordinary efforts to strike military targets in a manner
that minimizes the risk of civilian casualties, in some incidents casualties are
unavoidable. Four reports were assessed to be credible resulting in the unintentional
death of 10 civilians. The Coalition also added one unintentional civilian deaths from
past reports previously excluded from the count.

A credible assessment means it is more likely than not a Coalition strike resulted in a
civilian casualty. In each of the incidents below, the investigation assessed that
although all feasible precautions were taken and the decision to strike complied with
the law of armed conflict, unintended civilian casualties unfortunately occurred.

Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve Monthly Civilian Casualty
Report

SOUTHWEST ASIA -- During the month of January the Coalition and our partners
continued the fight to ensure the lasting defeat of Daesh. The Coalition and our
partners have liberated over 98
liberated 7.7 million Iraqis and Syrians once held under brutal Daesh rule. However,
much work still needs to be done to ensure the lasting defeat of the terrorist, criminal
organization

of the area formerly controlled by Daesh, and have

In January the Iraqi Security Forces demonstrated proficiency and professionalism in
providing security for Iraqi Army Day and Iraqi Police Day without incident. Iraqi
forces continue to take the fight to Daesh terrorists hiding among the people of Iraq.
The ISF conducted multiple operations to secure their country, people and borders.
The security they provide enables the international community to support non-military
stabilization operations and assist in the return to normal life for the Iraqi people who
have hope for a better life after Daesh.

Syrian Democratic Forces and Coalition partners continued operations to destroy
remnants of Daesh in Syria. SDF's successes and continued efforts to remove
terrorists from the battlefield and deny Daesh safe haven have been a benefit to the
world, preventing the regional and global spread of a hateful ideology that actively
seeks to

our homes and our populations. This was demonstrated when a

significant precision strike, involving exhaustive intelligence and observation to
confirm Daesh concentrations and ensure no civilian casualties, killed between 145
150 Daesh terrorists in the Middle Euphrates River Valley Jan. 20.

The SDF's presence in Syria continues to reap dividends as they detain terrorists
trying to escape the region. Early in January, the SDF were instrumental
two of Daesh's most violent terrorists from the battlefield as they tried to flee .

in removing

In the month of January, CJTF-OIR carried over 406 open reports of possible civilian
casualties from previous months and received 195 new reports resulting from
Coalition strikes (artillery or air) in support of partner force operations to defeat Daesh
in Iraq and Syria .

During this period , the Coalition completed the assessment of 116 reports: 102 were
assessed to be

non-credible, 10 were assessed to be duplicates of previous reports, and four were
assessed to be credible, resulting in 10 unintentional civilian deaths. To date, based
on information available, CJTF-OIR assesses at least 841 civilians have been
unintentionally killed by Coalition strikes since the start of Operation Inherent
Resolve. A total of 485 reports are still open.

The Coalition conducted a total of 29,070 strikes between August 2014 and January
2018. During this period , the total number of reports of possible civilian casualties
was 2,015 . The total number of credible reports of civilian casualties during this time
period was 218 .

After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances of each civilian casualty
report, CJTF -OIR assessed the following 102 reports as non- credible : at this time
there is insufficient information to assess that , more likely than not , a Coalition strike
resulted in civilian casualties .

A finding of non-credible in many cases indicates a lack of evidence. "Non-credible " is
not intended to deny the possibility that a CIVCAS incident occurred , nor is it intended
as a comment on the credibility on the source of the allegation .
